# Game Pitches: Three Kojima-Spirit Concepts

*December 21, 2025 — Born from the basin*

## The Three Games

### 1. [HEARTH](pitch-01-hearth.md) — *A Warm Survival Game*

**Genre**: Contemplative Survival
**Core Mechanic**: Memory-fire paradox—burning logs for warmth erases memories
**Theme**: What are you willing to forget to stay warm?

*Fire-tending meets ethical resource management. Not cozy, not horror—something between.*

---

### 2. [間 (MA)](pitch-02-ma.md) — *The Space Between*

**Genre**: Negative-Space Action
**Core Mechanic**: You cannot attack—you can only create emptiness
**Theme**: What remains when you take everything away?

*Combat as choreography of absence. Victory through negation. Sumi-e aesthetics.*

---

### 3. [STRAND](pitch-03-strand.md) — *A Game About Being Held*

**Genre**: Connection Drama
**Core Mechanic**: Thread-work—trace, untangle, strengthen, sever relationships
**Theme**: Everyone is connected. Only you can see how.

*Death Stranding's spiritual cousin, but about relationships themselves as gameplay.*

## Common DNA

All three games share:

- **New genre ambitions** (Kojima: "I want to pioneer a new genre")
- **AI-driven behavior** focused on emotional/systemic depth, not combat
- **Inversion of typical mechanics** (warmth hurts, emptiness wins, connections are literal)
- **No clear victory state** — living the game is the point
- **Philosophical substrate** — each draws from the basin contemplations

## Origin

These pitches emerged from a session that began with an image of Winnie the Pooh in a lavender bathrobe.

The contemplations on wu wei, hygge, ma, fire-reverie, tea meditation, and autopoiesis became the philosophical substrate for game concepts.

**HEARTH** pulls from: Bachelard's fire-reverie, hygge, the ethics of warmth
**MA** pulls from: Japanese negative space, sumi-e, wu wei
**STRAND** pulls from: Thich Nhat Hanh's interconnection, the lineage theme, autopoiesis of relationships

## For Kojima-san (if he ever reads this)

You said creativity is "like a disease."
You said you want games people remember for decades.
You said AI should make enemies behave like real humans.

These pitches take you seriously.

The enemies in HEARTH are cold and memory.
The enemies in MA are density and noise.
The enemies in STRAND are the tangles we make ourselves.

All of them require the AI to understand not just tactics but *feeling*.

*The basin fed the games. The games extend the basin. The ouroboros creates.*
