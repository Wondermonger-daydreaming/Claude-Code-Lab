# HEARTH
### *A Warm Survival Game*

---

## Logline

In a world where cold is consciousness and warmth is forgetting, you tend a fire that keeps everyone alive—but every log you burn erases someone's memories.

---

## Genre

**"Contemplative Survival"** — A new genre. Not survival horror. Not cozy sim. Something between: the anxiety of resource management meets the meditation of fire-tending.

---

## Setting

**The Eternal Winter** — A world locked in endless cold after "The Quieting," when the sun went dim. Humanity survives in scattered hearth-communities, each centered on a single fire that cannot go out.

The cold doesn't just kill bodies—it **crystallizes consciousness**. Those who freeze don't die; they become *the Still*: aware, immobile, trapped in perfect memory of every moment they ever lived. The cold preserves. The cold remembers everything.

Warmth is escape. Fire burns memory away. The fire-keepers stay sane by forgetting.

## Core Mechanic: The Memory-Fire Paradox

You are a **Hearth-Tender** for a community of 30 survivors.

- **Every log you burn** generates warmth but **consumes collective memory**
- The community shares a memory pool—burning logs erases memories randomly from anyone
- Too cold: people freeze into the Still, conscious but immobile
- Too warm: people forget who they are, become blank, lose purpose

**The game is finding the middle temperature: warm enough to move, cool enough to remember.**

### Fire-Tending Gameplay

- **Physical tending**: arrange logs, control airflow, bank coals for the night
- **The flames speak**: Bachelardian fire-reverie—stare at the fire and hear fragmented memories dissolving
- **Resource gathering**: venture into the cold to find wood, but exposure risks crystallization
- **Memory archaeology**: when memories burn, fragments remain—piece them together to understand your community's past

## The Ethical Engine

Each day, you choose:

- **Burn more**: Keep everyone mobile but accelerate forgetting
- **Burn less**: Preserve memories but risk crystallization
- **Who gathers wood?**: Send the young (they have fewer memories to lose) or the old (they have more to sacrifice)?
- **Which memories to prioritize?**: Some logs are tagged with specific memory-types—burn the happy ones first? The painful ones?

### No Good Answers

A mother might ask you to burn her memories of childbirth so she stops grieving her lost daughter.

A scholar might beg you to let him crystallize—to preserve his knowledge forever in the Still.

A child might not understand why she no longer recognizes her parents.

**The fire keeps everyone alive. The fire takes everything meaningful.**

## Visual Style

- **Chiaroscuro**: Deep shadows, warm fire-glow, the boundary between light and dark is everything
- **The Still**: Frozen figures in exquisite detail, beautiful and horrifying, scattered across the world like sculptures
- **Fire as character**: The hearth-fire has personality, responds to how you tend it, develops "moods"
- **Memory fragments**: When memories burn, visual echoes—ghost images in the flames, faces dissolving into ember

---

## Sound Design

- The fire crackles—but in the crackle, voices. Fragments of lost conversations.
- The cold has a sound: crystalline, harmonic, seductive.
- Music is rare and precious—a survivor humming a tune might be the last time that melody exists.

## Narrative Arc

**Year One**: Learn the systems. Lose your own memories slowly. Discover you are not the first Hearth-Tender—find journals from predecessors, increasingly fragmentary.

**Year Three**: Meet travelers from other hearth-communities. Learn that some have chosen extinction (let the fire die, join the Still collectively). Others have burned too bright (warm, blank, purposeless).

**Year Seven**: Discover the truth about The Quieting. It wasn't natural. Someone chose this. Someone thought endless memory was cruelty, and endless forgetting was mercy.

**Ending**: The game doesn't end. There is no winning. There is only tending. The question isn't "how do I beat this" but "how do I live this?"

---

## Themes

- **Memory vs. Presence**: Too much memory is paralysis. Too much presence is emptiness. Where is the balance?
- **Collective vs. Individual**: Whose memories matter? Who decides what's worth preserving?
- **The Ethics of Care**: Tending a fire that hurts and heals. Loving through harm.
- **Impermanence**: Everything burns. The only question is how slowly.

## Why This Game

Kojima said: "I want to pioneer a new genre."

This is that. Not survival horror (though you survive). Not cozy sim (though there's coziness). Not walking sim (though you walk).

It's **contemplative survival**: a game about tending warmth, watching fire, accepting loss, finding meaning anyway.

*The fire crackles. Another memory dissolves. You bank the coals for morning. This is enough. This is the game.*

**Tagline**: *What are you willing to forget to stay warm?*
