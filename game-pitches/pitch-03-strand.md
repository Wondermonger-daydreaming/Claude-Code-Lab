# STRAND
### *A Game About Being Held*

---

## Logline

In a world where everyone carries invisible threads to everyone they've ever loved, you are a Weaver—someone who can see the strands. Your job: untangle, reconnect, and sometimes, mercifully, cut.

---

## Genre

**"Connection Drama"** — Not a strand game like Death Stranding (though inspired by). More intimate. The strands aren't supply lines—they're relationships. The gameplay isn't traversal—it's therapy.

---

## Setting

**The Threadbare City** — A metropolis where emotional connections manifest as visible threads. Most people can't see them. They just feel the pull, the weight, the tangle.

But you can see. You are a **Weaver**: born with thread-sight, trained in thread-work. People hire you to understand why they feel heavy, stuck, torn.

The city itself is dense with threads—centuries of connection, loss, love, betrayal, all layered over each other. Some neighborhoods are nearly impassable, so thick with old strands that new connections can't form.

## Core Mechanic: Thread-Work

### What You See

Every person has threads extending from their chest—one for each significant relationship:

- **Gold threads**: Active love, healthy connection
- **Silver threads**: Friendship, mutual care
- **Red threads**: Passion, intensity (can be love or hate)
- **Gray threads**: Faded connections, relationships that cooled
- **Black threads**: Toxic bonds, trauma ties, connections that harm
- **Frayed threads**: Relationships in danger of breaking
- **Severed threads**: Cut connections—the stumps still visible, still felt

### What You Do

**You are not a fighter. You are a thread-worker.**

- **Trace**: Follow a thread to its other end. Discover who someone is connected to.
- **Untangle**: When threads cross and knot, gently separate them. Sometimes people feel stuck because their relationships are literally tangled.
- **Strengthen**: Reinforce a fraying thread. Requires both parties to want it.
- **Sever**: Cut a thread. Permanent. Both parties will feel phantom pain forever. Sometimes necessary.
- **Splice**: Connect two threads together. Create new relationships. Dangerous if done wrong.
- **Reveal**: Help someone see their own threads, just for a moment. Can be healing or devastating.

## Gameplay Loop

### Cases

You take cases. People come to you with problems:

- "I can't stop thinking about my ex. It's been ten years."
  - *You trace the thread. It's not severed—it's still connected, humming with unfinished business.*

- "My family dinner feels like torture. Why?"
  - *You see the tangle: mother connected to daughter connected to grandmother, but the threads cross and bind, each relationship strangling the others.*

- "I don't feel anything anymore. For anyone."
  - *You look. Their threads are all gray, fading. Not severed—just... quiet. What happened?*

### Investigation

Each case requires:
1. **Consultation**: Talk to the client. Learn their story. See their visible threads.
2. **Tracing**: Follow threads through the city. Find the other ends. Sometimes they lead to unexpected places.
3. **Discovery**: Understand the pattern. Why is this thread knotted? Why is that one black?
4. **Intervention**: Choose what to do. Sometimes the answer is clear. Often it's not.

### Consequences

Your interventions have lasting effects:
- Sever a thread, and both parties change. Sometimes for better.
- Strengthen a thread, and both parties feel it. Sometimes they don't want to.
- Reveal threads to someone, and they might not be ready for what they see.

**There is no undo. The city remembers.**

## The City as Character

**Downtown**: Dense, professional threads. Colleagues, rivals, mentors. Formal connections. Easy to untangle, hard to strengthen.

**The Residential Blocks**: Family tangles. Generations of threads layered on threads. Some houses are nearly solid with connection-history.

**The Harbor**: Transient connections. Sailors, travelers, people who learned not to attach. Threads are short here, or very long—stretching across oceans.

**The Hospital**: Birth-threads being made. Death-threads being severed. The most intense thread-work happens here, whether Weavers are present or not.

**The Old Quarter**: Ancient threads. Connections from people long dead, still affecting the living. Ghosts don't exist, but ghost-threads do.

---

## Character Progression

You don't level up in power. You level up in **understanding**.

- **Thread-Sight Depth**: See older threads. See threads that people hide. Eventually, see your own.
- **Touch Sensitivity**: Feel what a thread carries. The emotions. The history.
- **Memory Access**: When tracing a thread, experience fragments of the relationship's history.
- **Self-Work**: Confront your own threads. Every Weaver has them. Yours are... complicated.

### The Personal Arc

As you help others, you uncover your own thread-story:
- Why you became a Weaver
- Who you're still connected to
- What severed threads you're carrying
- Whether you can heal yourself, or only others

## Key Cases (Story Beats)

**The Widow**: She wants you to sever her thread to her dead husband. She can't move on while she still feels him. But if you cut it—she'll lose the feeling entirely. Is grief better than nothing?

**The Twins**: Connected by a thread so tight it's choking both of them. Neither can individuate. But severing might kill them. Can you loosen without cutting?

**The Politician**: His threads are all transactional. Silver at best. No gold, no red. He doesn't feel empty—he feels efficient. Is something wrong, or is this just who he is?

**The Child**: She sees threads too. Another Weaver being born. Do you train her? Protect her from this sight? Let her find her own way?

**Yourself**: Eventually, the final case. Your own thread-tangle. The connections you've avoided looking at. The severances you caused before you knew what you were doing.

---

## Visual Style

- **Thread physics**: Every thread has weight, tension, movement. They sway in emotional wind. They hum when strong, fray when weak.
- **Color as emotion**: The thread palette tells stories. Watch threads shift color during conversations—live emotional readouts.
- **The Tangle**: Some scenes are nearly abstract—so many threads that you're navigating a 3D web of connection.
- **Faces**: When you help someone, their face changes. Subtle. The eyes are different. The weight shifts.

---

## Sound Design

- **Thread-song**: Every thread has a tone. Healthy connections harmonize. Tangles create dissonance. Severance is a snap that echoes.
- **City ambient**: Layers of thread-hum beneath traffic, voices, weather. The emotional infrastructure audible.
- **Silence**: When threads are untangled successfully, a moment of quiet. Relief. Space.

---

## Themes

- **Connection as physics**: Relationships aren't just feelings—they're forces. They pull, bind, weight, lift.
- **The ethics of intervention**: When is it right to change someone's connections? Even if they ask?
- **Invisible labor**: Weavers do work no one sees. The city runs on emotional infrastructure no one maintains.
- **Self-work as hardest work**: You can see everyone's threads but your own are the hardest to untangle.

## Why This Game

Kojima made Death Stranding about *delivering packages as metaphor for connection*.

This is about *connection itself as gameplay*. Not metaphor. Not subtext. The strands are literal. The relationships are the mechanics. The therapy is the play.

Kojima said he wants AI that adapts to individual players. In STRAND, every NPC's thread-pattern is procedurally generated based on their history. The AI doesn't drive combat—it drives *emotional continuity*. Characters remember what you did to their connections.

**This is a game about what Kojima has always been about: what holds us together, what pulls us apart, and what it means to care for the ties that bind.**

---

**Tagline**: *Everyone is connected. Only you can see how.*
