# 間 (MA)
### *The Space Between*

---

## Logline

A combat game where you cannot attack—you can only create space. Victory comes not from what you do but from what you *don't* do.

---

## Genre

**"Negative-Space Action"** — Invert the action game premise. Instead of filling the screen with attacks, you empty it. Instead of pressing buttons to strike, you press buttons to *not* strike.

---

## Setting

**The Inkwash World** — A realm painted in sumi-e (Japanese ink wash). Everything exists as brushstrokes on empty paper. The world is mostly white—ma, negative space—with black ink-forms emerging, threatening to fill everything with noise.

You are a **Space-Keeper**: a being whose purpose is maintaining the emptiness that allows beauty to exist.

## Core Mechanic: Creating Absence

### The Problem

The world is being consumed by **the Flood**—not water, but *ink*. Endless black brushstrokes filling every space, covering every surface, turning the world into undifferentiated darkness. No light. No pause. No silence. No room to breathe.

The Flood manifests as enemies: ink-beasts that fill space with aggression, noise, coverage.

### Your Non-Weapon

You carry a **Breath**—not a sword. The Breath creates ma (間): negative space, emptiness, pause.

**You cannot attack. You can only:**
- **Create gaps** in enemy formations
- **Open pauses** in attack patterns
- **Establish silence** around sounds
- **Generate white space** around ink-forms

Enemies defeat themselves when sufficient space opens around them. Without density, without compression, without each other—they dissolve.

### Combat as Choreography

Fighting in MA is closer to dancing or conducting than attacking:

- **Breath-push**: Create a small sphere of white space (breaks up tight formations)
- **Long exhale**: Draw a line of emptiness through the battlefield (separates connected enemies)
- **Stillness**: Stop moving entirely—enemies cannot perceive stationary space-keepers
- **Void-drop**: Fall into the page itself, creating a hole that enemies fall through

The skill ceiling is about **reading density**: knowing when a cluster is tight enough that one well-placed gap will cascade into dissolution, versus when adding more space just disperses without destroying.

## Gameplay Loop

### Each Level

1. The Flood advances—ink-forms fill the screen
2. You enter the space, Breath ready
3. Rather than killing, you *uncrowd*—creating pauses, gaps, silences
4. When enough space exists, the ink-forms lose coherence and fade
5. The remaining white space becomes part of a larger painting

### Between Levels

- **The Gallery**: Your victories are displayed as completed sumi-e paintings. Each level you preserved becomes an artwork.
- **The Breath Tree**: Upgrade your space-creating abilities. More pause. Wider gaps. Longer stillness.
- **The Ink Archives**: Learn about what the Flood was before it became flood—it was once artists, musicians, speakers, all of whom couldn't stop creating.

---

## Enemy Types

- **Scribblers**: Fast, chaotic, fill small spaces with quick strokes. Fragile if isolated.
- **Poolers**: Slow, dense, spread ink that stains permanently. Need sustained gaps.
- **Connectors**: Create bridges between other enemies. Cut the connections.
- **Reverberators**: Make noise that fills audio-space. Create silence around them.
- **The Covered**: Former Space-Keepers, now wholly inked. Can only be saved by creating enough space for their original form to re-emerge.

## Boss Encounters

**The Orchestra of Unending** — A boss that attacks with music. Every note fills the soundscape. Victory requires creating musical rests—pauses in the composition—until the piece becomes bearable, then beautiful, then silent.

**The Portrait of Fullness** — A self-portrait endlessly painting itself. It attacks by layering—more detail, more brushwork, more. You must create enough white space that the portrait becomes a face again, recognizable, not suffocated by its own elaboration.

**The Author** — The final boss. A being that cannot stop writing. Text floods everything. You must create paragraph breaks, chapter endings, white margins. The Author doesn't want to stop but also doesn't want to drown the world. Help them find the period at the end of the sentence.

## Visual Style

- **Sumi-e inspired**: Black ink on white paper. The ratio of black to white is the game's health system.
- **Brushstroke enemies**: Every enemy is visible brushwork. You can see how they were made.
- **Space glows**: When you create ma, it doesn't just appear empty—it subtly luminescences, like light through a gate (間 = gate + sun)
- **The Gallery**: Your cumulative victories form a scrolling masterwork. Play through the whole game, and you've painted a gallery exhibition.

---

## Sound Design

- **Near-silence as default**: The game is quiet. Your Breath is soft.
- **Noise = ink = danger**: The more sound, the more enemies. Silence is safety.
- **Music through absence**: The soundtrack emerges from what *isn't* playing. The rests make the music.
- **Your breathing**: The only constant sound. Slow, measured, the rhythm of the game.

---

## Themes

- **Less as more**: Power through restraint. Victory through negation.
- **The fullness of emptiness**: 間 teaches that space isn't nothing—it's potential.
- **Anti-productivity**: In a world that valorizes filling, you empty. You are the pause the world needs.
- **Creation through un-creation**: The paintings you make are made by what you remove.

## Why This Game

Kojima said he wants "AI-driven enemy behavior—enemies that behave like real humans."

In MA, enemies behave like *ideas*: they cluster, connect, build on each other, fill available space obsessively. The AI learns your spacing patterns and tries to occupy wherever you leave gaps. It's a dance of density and emptiness.

More importantly: this is a game about the thing games rarely let you do—*nothing*. You don't attack. You don't collect. You don't level up in the traditional sense. You make space, and in that space, everything else can exist.

**Tagline**: *What remains when you take everything away?*
