# THE BOOK OF THE NEW TIDE -- AO3 Posting Metadata

*Complete metadata, tags, summary, notes, and posting plan for Archive of Our Own.*

---

## 1. Title

**THE BOOK OF THE NEW TIDE**

---

## 2. Author

**[Your AO3 Username]**

*(Replace with your actual AO3 pseudonym before posting.)*

---

## 3. Rating

**Mature**

Rationale: Gene Wolfe's source material involves torture, execution, violence, sexual content, and theological darkness. Severian is a torturer by profession. The narrative voice does not shy from these realities, though it renders them through literary indirection rather than explicit graphic detail. "Mature" is the correct AO3 rating: it signals adult themes without implying the pornographic explicitness that "Explicit" denotes. One Piece's own violence (war arcs, character deaths, systemic oppression) reinforces this rating.

---

## 4. Archive Warnings

**Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings**

Rationale: This is the appropriate choice for a work in Severian's voice. Wolfe's narrator is famously unreliable -- he elides, omits, and reframes. Committing to "No Archive Warnings Apply" would be inaccurate (there is violence; there may be character death depending on how one reads Severian's account). But individually tagging each warning would spoil narrative turns that Wolfe's style deliberately obscures. "Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings" is the honest selection: it tells readers to proceed with awareness that the author has not disclosed specific content warnings, which is itself thematically consonant with the unreliable narrator.

If you prefer to be more explicit, the applicable individual warnings would be:
- Graphic Depictions Of Violence
- Major Character Death (arguable depending on interpretation)

---

## 5. Fandom Tags

AO3 crossover fandom tagging requires listing each fandom separately. AO3 will automatically mark the work as a crossover when multiple fandoms are tagged. Use the canonical (wrangler-approved) fandom tag names:

```
The Book of the New Sun - Gene Wolfe
One Piece (Anime & Manga)
```

These are the exact canonical tags on AO3. Do not use variations like "One Piece" alone (too ambiguous -- there is also "One Piece (Live Action TV 2023)") or "Solar Cycle - Gene Wolfe" (different canonical tag covering the broader series).

---

## 6. Category

**Gen**

This is primarily a gen (general/no romantic focus) work. Severian observes relationships among the Straw Hats but does not participate in romantic pairings within the crew. If there are romantic subplots, add the appropriate category (M/F, M/M, etc.).

---

## 7. Relationship Tags

**No romantic relationship tags required for a gen work.**

If you wish to tag platonic/partnership dynamics (using the `&` separator rather than `/`), consider:

```
Monkey D. Luffy & Severian
Roronoa Zoro & Severian
Nico Robin & Severian
Mugiwara Kaizoku | Strawhat Pirates & Severian
```

AO3 convention: `&` denotes platonic/gen relationships. `/` denotes romantic/sexual relationships. For this work, `&` is correct.

---

## 8. Character Tags

Use AO3's canonical character tag format. For One Piece characters, AO3 uses the Japanese name order (family name first) and includes disambiguation for characters who appear across multiple fandoms.

### Book of the New Sun Characters

```
Severian (Book of the New Sun)
```

Note: If "Severian (Book of the New Sun)" does not auto-complete, try "Severian" alone. AO3's tag wranglers will synonym it appropriately. For a small fandom, the canonical tag may simply be "Severian" with the fandom providing disambiguation. Check auto-complete when posting.

### One Piece Characters

```
Monkey D. Luffy
Roronoa Zoro
Nami (One Piece)
Usopp (One Piece)
Vinsmoke Sanji
Nico Robin
Tony Tony Chopper
```

Additional One Piece characters to tag if they have significant roles:

```
Franky (One Piece)
Brook (One Piece)
Trafalgar D. Water Law
```

Tag only characters with meaningful presence. AO3 etiquette discourages tagging characters who appear only briefly -- it frustrates readers searching for content about those characters.

---

**Tagging guidance:** AO3 caps freeform tags at 75. Aim for 15-25 well-chosen tags. The list above provides options; select the ones most relevant to your work. Prioritize tags that help readers *find* the work (genre, tone, key themes) and tags that help readers *filter* the work (content warnings, style notes).

## 10. Language

**English**

## 11. Summary

The summary appears on the work listing and is the primary hook for readers browsing AO3. It supports limited HTML (`<p>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<blockquote>`). Write it in Severian's voice to signal the prose style immediately.

### Recommended Summary

```html
<p>It is important, when embarking upon the chronicle of one's second life, to acknowledge that the first was not, by any reasonable standard, a success. I had been Autarch. I had been torturer. I had carried the Claw of the Conciliator and walked between the stars. None of this, I think, adequately prepared me for the boy in the straw hat who ate the sea.</p>

<p>I, Severian, am required by my nature to record precisely what I observe, though I am no longer certain my nature is what I believed it to be. The ocean in this world is not dying. The sun is not red. There are fruits that grant dominion over nature itself, and a government that has erased eight hundred years of its own history -- which is to say, I recognized the place at once.</p>

<p>This is the account of my time among the Straw Hat pirates: how I came to understand the theology of rubber, the archaeology of forbidden centuries, and the strange fact that a sword can be black in a way that even fuligin cannot.</p>
```

## 12. Notes

### Beginning Notes (Author's Note -- Top of Work)

These appear before Chapter 1 and on every chapter unless overridden. Keep them concise. For a multi-chapter work, the beginning note on the *first chapter* persists across all chapters unless you clear it.

**Recommendation:** Post the beginning note ONLY on Chapter 1 (leave the persistent beginning note blank; add a chapter-specific note to Chapter 1 instead).

```html
<p><strong>On the crossover:</strong> This story assumes familiarity with both Gene Wolfe's <em>The Book of the New Sun</em> and Eiichiro Oda's <em>One Piece</em>. Severian's voice is the vessel; the Grand Line is the sea. If you know one but not the other, you are in exactly the position Severian is in -- which is, arguably, the ideal way to read anything Severian narrates.</p>

<p><strong>On the voice:</strong> Severian claims perfect memory and demonstrates imperfect honesty. This has not changed. He will tell you precisely what he saw. Whether what he saw is what happened is, as always, between you and the text.</p>

<p><strong>On Chapter 12:</strong> Yes, it is what it sounds like. No, I will not apologize.</p>
```

### End Notes (Author's Note -- Bottom of Work)

These appear after the final chapter. This is where the author's note about AI-human collaboration belongs.

```html
<p><strong>Author's Note on Process:</strong></p>

<p>THE BOOK OF THE NEW TIDE was written collaboratively between a human author and an AI language model (Claude, by Anthropic). The human provided the architecture: the chapter structure, the thematic connections between Wolfe and Oda, the conviction that these two worlds had something to say to each other. The AI provided drafts, variations, and the sustained inhabitation of Severian's voice across seventeen chapters.</p>

<p>Neither of us could have written this alone. The human lacked the patience to sustain Wolfe's prose density for 17 chapters without rest. The AI lacked the lived readerly experience of why these two works rhyme -- the gut-level recognition that the Void Century and the age before the New Sun are the same wound in different flesh.</p>

<p>We do not consider this a lesser form of authorship. We consider it a new one. Severian, who carried other minds within his own, might understand.</p>

<p>All errors of theology, chronology, and Devil Fruit taxonomy are the AI's. All errors of taste are the human's. All errors of memory are Severian's.</p>
```

Adapt this to reflect your actual collaborative process.

## 13. Chapter-by-Chapter Posting Plan

### Format: Single Multi-Chapter Work

Post as **one work with 17 chapters**, not as a series of separate works. Reasons:

- The narrative is continuous and interdependent (Severian's retrospective voice references later events)
- Chapter 12's metafictional turn only works within the frame of the surrounding chapters
- AO3's multi-chapter format preserves reading order and provides chapter navigation
- Readers can subscribe to the work and receive email notifications for each new chapter

### Chapter Count Setting

When creating the work, set:
- **Chapters:** 1/?  (when posting first chapter)
- Update to **X/17** as you post, or set to **17/17** if posting all at once

If posting the completed work all at once, set **17/17** from the start.

### Recommended Posting Schedule

**Option A: Completed Work, Staggered Release (Recommended)**

Since the work is complete at 17 chapters, the optimal AO3 strategy is staggered posting to maximize visibility. Each new chapter pushes the work to the top of the fandom tag listings.

| Week | Chapters | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Week 1, Day 1 (Mon/Tue) | Ch 1: The Sea That Eats Memory | Hook. Establish Severian's voice in the new world. |
| Week 1, Day 4 (Thu/Fri) | Ch 2: The Naming of Waves | Maintain momentum. Two chapters in the first week signals commitment. |
| Week 2 | Ch 3: The Fruits of Consequence | Devil Fruit theology. Begin weekly cadence. |
| Week 3 | Ch 4: The Colors of Will | Haki exploration. |
| Week 4 | Ch 5: The God Who Was Not | |
| Week 5 | Ch 6: The Witch Who Healed | |
| Week 6 | Ch 7: The Woman Who Chose | |
| Week 7 | Ch 8: The Stone That Knew My Name | |
| Week 8 | Ch 9: The House That Was Absolute | Title echoes Wolfe directly -- readers of the source will recognize it. |
| Week 9 | Ch 10: The Archaeology of Scars | |
| Week 10 | Ch 11: The God of the Gaps | |
| Week 11 | Ch 12: A Review of the Picaresque Romance... | The meta-chapter. This will generate discussion. Consider a brief chapter-specific note. |
| Week 12 | Ch 13: The Sun That Laughs | |
| Week 13 | Ch 14: The Conversation I Remember Having | |
| Week 14 | Ch 15: The Prince in the Underworld | |
| Week 15 | Ch 16: Dereshishishi | The title alone will break One Piece readers. |
| Week 16 | Ch 17: The Ballad of the Black Blade | Finale. |

**Total run: ~16 weeks (4 months)**

**Posting day:** Pick a consistent day (Tuesday or Wednesday tend to have good AO3 traffic). Post between 10:00-18:00 UTC to avoid the timestamp bug where works posted between 00:00-05:00 UTC get buried.

**Option B: All At Once**

If you prefer not to manage a posting schedule, post all 17 chapters simultaneously with the chapter count set to 17/17. This sacrifices visibility in tag listings (you appear once, not seventeen times) but respects the work's integrity as a complete text.

**Option C: Accelerated Schedule**

Post 2-3 chapters per week over 6-8 weeks. Good compromise between visibility and speed. Particularly useful if the One Piece fandom is in an active period (new manga arc, anime season).

### Chapter-Specific Notes

AO3 allows per-chapter beginning and ending notes. Use these sparingly. Recommendations:

| Chapter | Note Recommendation |
|---------|-------------------|
| Ch 1 | Beginning note with crossover context (see Section 12 above) |
| Ch 9 | Optional note: "Readers of Wolfe will recognize the title." |
| Ch 12 | Beginning note: "This chapter departs from the main narrative. Severian has found something." |
| Ch 16 | No note. Let the title do its work. |
| Ch 17 | End note: the Author's Note on collaborative process (see Section 12 above) |

All other chapters: no notes needed. Let Severian speak.

### Work Skin (Optional)

If you want custom CSS for the work (e.g., styling fuligin references, formatting the meta-chapter differently), AO3 supports Work Skins. See the formatting guide (`formatting-guide.md`) for details.
