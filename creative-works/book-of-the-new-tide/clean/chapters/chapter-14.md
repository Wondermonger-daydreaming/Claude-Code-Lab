# Chapter Fourteen: The Conversation I Remember Having

I must tell you now of a conversation that occurred on the deck of the Thousand Sunny—for we had by this time acquired a new ship, the Merry having died in a manner I have not yet recorded and may never fully be able to record, as there are some losses that resist the fixity of text.

Or perhaps I have recorded it. My account has grown long, and I find I cannot always recall what I have set down and what remains only in memory. The reader must forgive these lapses; they are not evasions but simply the consequence of carrying too many stories at once.

The conversation was with Zoro, and it concerned the nature of gods.

---

I should say first that I am not certain the conversation happened exactly as I will describe it. Zoro is not a man given to philosophical discourse; his thoughts tend toward the concrete, the practical, the immediately applicable to the question of how to become stronger. It is possible that I have elaborated his words in recollection, attributed to him articulations he would not himself have chosen.

But this is always the case with remembered speech. We do not record; we reconstruct. And in reconstruction, we cannot help but shape the material to fit the architecture of our understanding.

With that caveat, I proceed.

---

"You've been weird since Wano," Zoro said.

We were alone at the stern, the night watch ours by the rotation Nami had established. The sea was calm—too calm, I thought, though I did not say so. The Grand Line's calms often presage storms of a violence the Commonwealth never knew.

"Weird how?" I asked, though I knew what he meant.

"Watching him different." Zoro jerked his chin toward the front of the ship, where Luffy slept in his favorite spot, draped over the lion figurehead like a child exhausted by play. "Before, you watched him like you were trying to figure something out. Now you watch him like you already know and you don't like the answer."

I considered denying this. The guild trained us in denial—in the careful construction of surfaces that reveal nothing of the depths beneath. But Zoro had earned honesty from me, in the way that those who fight beside you earn it.

"He is a god," I said.

"Yeah." Zoro's tone was flat, unimpressed. "So?"

"In my world, gods were distant. They worked through intermediaries, through signs and portents, through the slow accumulation of events that revealed their purposes only in retrospect. To stand in the presence of a god was—" I paused, searching for the right word. "—shattering. The Hierogrammates were not gods, but they were close enough that meeting them changed the structure of my understanding."

"And Luffy doesn't shatter you."

"Luffy makes me laugh."

Zoro grunted. It was, I had learned, his way of indicating that a point had landed.

"That bother you?" he asked.

"Yes. No." I shook my head. "I do not know. It should not matter what form divinity takes. A god who laughs is no less a god than a god who judges. And yet—"

"You expected something else."

"I expected weight. Gravity. The sense that existence itself bends around the divine presence." I looked at Luffy, his limbs slack in sleep, a thread of drool connecting his mouth to the wooden mane beneath him. "He has the power to remake reality. I have seen him do it. And he uses it to make his fists bigger and to turn his enemies into bouncing balls."

"That's what bothers you? That he's not serious enough?"

"That is not—" I stopped. Was that what bothered me? "I do not know."

---

(I have set down that exchange as though it flowed naturally, but I am not certain it did. There may have been longer silences than I have indicated. Zoro may have taken a drink between his sentences—he often had a bottle with him on watch. I may have said other things that I have forgotten, or he may have, and the conversation as I record it is a compression of a longer, more fragmented dialogue.

This is not dishonesty. It is simply the nature of narrative. We cannot capture everything; we capture what seems essential and allow the rest to fall away.

But I note it because the reader should be aware that my certainty about what was said is not absolute. It never is. My memory does not fail, but memory and truth are not the same thing.)

---

"I'll tell you what bothers me," Zoro said, after a silence that may have lasted minutes or may have lasted only the time it takes to draw a breath. "You're jealous."

"I am not—"

"You are." He cut me off without rancor, simply stating a fact. "You spent your whole life serving a purpose. Bringing a new sun to your dying world. That was your *thing*. Your destiny or whatever. And now you find out there's already a sun here, and it doesn't need you to bring it. It's already walking around, laughing at everything, being an idiot."

"Luffy is not an idiot."

"He's the biggest idiot I've ever met. He's also going to be King of the Pirates." Zoro shrugged. "Both things are true."

I did not respond. The words had struck somewhere I did not wish to examine.

"Here's what I think," Zoro continued. "I think you're used to being the chosen one. The special one. The guy with the prophecy and the magic sword and the destiny. And now you're on a crew where everyone has that. Luffy's got Joy Boy. Robin's got the Poneglyphs. Nami's mapping the whole damn world. Even Chopper's got his thing—curing every disease, being the best doctor. We're all chosen. We all have purposes."

"And you?"

"Greatest swordsman in the world." He said it without boasting, simply naming what he pursued. "That's my purpose. Not because anyone chose me for it. Because I chose it for myself."

---

I think often about what he said next. I have replayed it in my mind more times than I can count, trying to determine if I have remembered it correctly or if I have altered it in recollection to fit a narrative I needed to believe.

He said: "Maybe your purpose isn't to be the sun. Maybe it's to be something else."

Or he said: "Maybe you need to find a new purpose."

Or he said nothing at all, and the silence stretched between us, and I projected into that silence what I wished he had said.

I do not know. I cannot know. This is the curse of perfect memory without perfect certainty—I remember what I perceived, but perception is not reality, and memory is not truth.

---

"What would you suggest?" I asked—this I am certain of, because I remember the bitter edge in my voice, the way the words came out sharper than I intended.

Zoro shrugged. "Not my job to figure out your purpose. That's on you." He stood, stretching muscles that never seemed to tire no matter how long he trained. "But I'll tell you this: Luffy doesn't need another sun. He's got that covered. What he might need is someone who knows what it costs. What it means to bring light to a dark world and watch people burn in the brightness."

"You think he does not know this?"

"I think he doesn't let himself think about it. Not because he's stupid—because if he thought about it, he'd stop. He'd get heavy, like you're heavy. And then he couldn't be what he is." Zoro looked at Luffy, and his expression shifted into something I had rarely seen on his face—tenderness, or something adjacent to it. "Someone has to think about it for him. Someone has to carry the weight he can't carry. Maybe that's you."

"The keeper of costs."

"If you want a fancy name for it." He turned to go, then paused. "Or you could just be crew. That's enough for the rest of us."

---

He left. I remained at the stern, watching the sea, thinking about what he had said.

(Or I left and he remained. I am no longer certain which of us ended the conversation. It should not matter—the content is what matters, not the choreography of departure—but I find myself troubled by the uncertainty. If I cannot remember who walked away, what else have I misremembered? What else have I constructed in the telling?)

---

I should record here an aside that concerns the nature of my narration.

The reader may have noticed that I often claim perfect memory while simultaneously expressing uncertainty about what occurred. This is not contradiction, though it appears to be. My memory does not fail—I recall every sensory impression, every word spoken in my presence, every shift of light and shadow. What fails is interpretation. What fails is the connection between the raw data of experience and the meaningful narrative we construct from that data.

I remember what I saw. I do not always know what I was seeing.

This is, I suspect, the condition of all conscious beings, though most do not recognize it. We believe our memories are records of reality; they are actually records of perception, which is a very different thing. The gap between the two is where error lives. Where self-deception flourishes. Where the stories we tell ourselves diverge, slowly but inexorably, from the stories we are actually living.

I tell you this so that you will read what follows with appropriate skepticism. Not disbelief—I am not lying, not deliberately. But skepticism, the recognition that even the most sincere account may contain distortions the narrator does not perceive.

---

The next morning, I sought out Robin.

She was in the library—the Sunny has a library, as the Merry did not, one of the many improvements Franky built into the new ship. She sat surrounded by books and papers, her reading glasses perched on her nose, her expression one of focused absorption.

"Severian," she said, without looking up. She always knew when I approached. Her Observation Haki was subtle but pervasive. "You have questions."

"How do you know?"

"You only seek me out when you have questions. Otherwise you prefer solitude." She turned a page. "It's not an insult. I understand the preference."

I sat across from her, waiting. She would acknowledge me fully when she reached a stopping point; I had learned not to rush her.

After a moment, she closed her book and removed her glasses. "Ask."

"Joy Boy," I said. "What do you actually know?"

"Less than I would like. More than the World Government wants anyone to know." She folded her hands on the table—a gesture I recognized as preparation for a lengthy exposition. Robin enjoyed explaining; it was one of the few pleasures she allowed herself openly.

"The name appears in three Poneglyphs that I've read directly, and is referenced obliquely in two others. He was a figure of the Void Century—possibly a king, possibly a revolutionary, possibly something else entirely. The title 'Joy Boy' may not even be a name in the conventional sense. It may be a role, like 'Autarch' in your world. A position that different individuals can hold."

"And Luffy holds it now."

"Luffy has *become* it. Which may or may not be the same thing." She paused, choosing her next words carefully. "The fruit he ate—the Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika—has been waiting eight hundred years for someone capable of awakening it. Others may have eaten it before him and failed to achieve what he achieved. The fruit chooses its wielder, in a sense, but the wielder must also prove worthy of being chosen."

"A mutual selection."

"If you like."

---

I hesitated before asking my next question. It was the question that had truly brought me here, and I was not certain I wanted to hear the answer.

"When he awakens fully—when he becomes whatever Joy Boy was meant to become—will he still be Luffy?"

Robin was silent for a long moment. Her expression did not change, but something in her eyes shifted—a flicker of the fear that she, like all of us, carried beneath her composure.

"I don't know," she said finally. "The historical records are unclear. Joy Boy is always spoken of as a single entity—but whether that entity was a person, a title, or something else entirely..." She shook her head. "What I can tell you is that Luffy, in his awakened state, still recognizes us. Still fights for us. Still laughs at the same things he always laughed at."

"But?"

"But there are moments." She looked away, toward the window that faced the sea. "Moments when his eyes are different. When his voice carries harmonics that shouldn't exist. When I feel, standing near him, that I am standing near something very old. Something that remembers more than any human could remember."

"Something that is not entirely Luffy."

"Something that Luffy is becoming part of. Or that is becoming part of him." She turned back to me, and her expression was the expression I had seen at Enies Lobby—the face of a woman confronting an impossible truth and choosing to move forward anyway. "Does it matter?"

"Does what matter?"

"Whether he's still Luffy. Whether the god has consumed the man or the man has tamed the god." She stood, moving to the window, her back to me. "He saved me. Whatever he is now, whatever he's becoming—he stood on a roof across an impossible gap and demanded that I claim my right to live. That's what I remember. That's what I hold onto."

---

I did not tell her, then, what I was thinking.

I was thinking of Thecla.

I was thinking of how I had consumed her memories through the alzabo's gift, how she had become part of me, how I sometimes lost track of where Severian ended and Thecla began. I was thinking of how that merger had felt—not like possession, not like erasure, but like *expansion*. Like becoming more than I had been, at the cost of becoming less certain of what I was.

Was Luffy experiencing something similar? Was Joy Boy's ancient consciousness flowing into him, changing him, making him larger and less defined? And if so—was that loss or gain?

I did not ask Robin these questions. Perhaps I should have. Perhaps she would have had answers, or at least perspectives I had not considered.

But I was afraid. Afraid of what she might say. Afraid of what her answer might reveal about my own condition.

So I thanked her for her time, and I left, and I did not speak of Thecla at all.

---

(The reader may note that I have just admitted to withholding information from a crewmate. This is true. I withheld, and I continue to withhold in smaller ways, the full truth of what I carry inside me.

Is this dishonesty? Perhaps. But I have never claimed to be fully honest. I have claimed only to set down what occurred as accurately as I can perceive it—and perception, as I have noted, is not the same as truth.

What I can say is that my reasons for withholding were not malicious. I did not conceal to harm. I concealed because some truths are too heavy to share until one has found the right words, the right moment, the right listener prepared to bear the weight.

Or perhaps I am rationalizing. Perhaps I concealed because I was ashamed, or afraid, or simply unwilling to make myself vulnerable.

I do not know. I am not always the best reader of my own motivations.

This, too, is part of the account.)

---

The confrontation with Kizaru came three days later.

I have not written of Kizaru before—Admiral Borsalino, the man who moves at the speed of light itself. He found us at Egghead, where we had gone seeking Vegapunk's knowledge, and he came with the full weight of the Government's wrath behind him.

I will not describe the battle in detail. Others have done so, and will do so again, and my perspective was limited—I saw only what occurred in my immediate vicinity, felt only the portions of the conflict that touched my Haki directly.

But I will record one moment, because it bears on everything I have been trying to understand.

Luffy was fighting Kizaru directly. The Admiral was light itself—literal light, his body transformed into photons that could not be struck, could not be captured, could move from place to place faster than thought. He was, in the taxonomy of this world's powers, among the most formidable opponents imaginable.

And Luffy was laughing.

Not the nervous laughter of fear, not the manic laughter of desperation. The genuine, delighted laughter of a child playing a game that has suddenly become interesting. He stretched, and bounced, and transformed his attacks into absurdist spectacles—giant fists that bent around corners, legs that coiled like springs, a body that seemed to exist in a space where physics was optional.

I watched him grab a beam of light.

This should not be possible. Light cannot be grasped; it is not matter, has no substance, exists only as wave and particle in configurations that the human hand cannot affect. But Luffy grabbed it, *physically grabbed it*, and bent it into a new shape, and threw it back at Kizaru with a force that sent the Admiral reeling.

And he laughed the entire time.

"Shishishi! Your light is bouncy too!"

---

Kizaru's face, in that moment, was the face of a man confronting something his worldview could not accommodate.

I recognized the expression. I had worn it myself, when I first saw Luffy stretch his arm across an impossible distance to catch the mast of a sinking ship. The expression of fundamental categories failing. Of reality revealing itself to be larger, stranger, more malleable than one had believed.

"What are you?" Kizaru asked. His voice, usually languid, had gone sharp with something that might have been fear.

Luffy grinned—that grin that contains everything, that refuses nothing, that welcomes even enemies into the scope of its joy.

"I'm the man who's gonna be King of the Pirates!"

And he hit Kizaru so hard that the Admiral—the man who was light, who had never been touched by anything slower than himself—went through three walls and did not get up.

---

After, when we had escaped—barely, at terrible cost, with wounds that would take weeks to heal—I found Luffy on the deck, staring at his own hands.

"Captain," I said.

He did not look up. "Severian."

"Are you alright?"

It was a foolish question. He had just fought an Admiral, had pushed his awakened form to its limits, had watched Vegapunk die while speaking truths to the world. No one could be alright after such a day.

But he considered the question seriously, as he considered all questions—not with the surface seriousness of diplomacy but with the deep seriousness of someone who believes that words matter, that questions deserve honest answers.

"I'm hungry," he said finally.

I waited. There was more; I could feel it.

"And I'm..." He flexed his fingers, opened and closed his hands as though confirming they were still his. "I'm still me. I think. When I was fighting Kizaru, when I was using *that* power, I could feel... something else. Something bigger. But it didn't try to take over. It just... helped."

"Joy Boy."

"Maybe. Or maybe it's just me, being more me than I knew how to be before." He finally looked up, and his eyes were the eyes I knew—not the ring-pupils of his awakened state but the ordinary dark eyes of Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, idiot and dreamer and whatever else he was becoming. "Does it matter?"

It was the same question Robin had asked. And I found I still did not have an answer.

---

"In my world," I said slowly, "I carried someone inside me. A woman I loved. Her memories became my memories, her thoughts became tangled with my thoughts. I have spent years trying to understand what that merger made me—whether I am still myself, whether she survives in me, whether we are two or one or something in between."

Luffy nodded, as though this made perfect sense. Perhaps, to him, it did.

"And?" he asked.

"And I have never resolved the question. Some days I feel like Severian, with Thecla's memories added. Other days I feel like someone new, neither Severian nor Thecla but a third thing that emerged from their combination. And some days—" I paused. "Some days I am not certain there is anyone here at all. Just patterns, interacting. Memories referring to other memories, with no self beneath them to hold them together."

"That sounds scary."

"It is."

Luffy was quiet for a moment. The ship rocked beneath us; the sea whispered its eternal susurrus against the hull.

Then he said: "But you're still here. Still fighting. Still crew."

"Yes."

"Then maybe that's the answer." He grinned, and the grin was not the god's grin—not the reality-warping expression of awakened Nika—but the simple, human grin of a young man who has decided not to worry about things he cannot control. "You're whoever you are when you're being crew. The rest is just—" He waved his hand vaguely. "—extra."

---

I wanted to argue. I wanted to say that identity was not so simple, that the questions I was asking could not be dismissed with a wave and a grin, that the philosophical problems I had spent years contemplating deserved more than "the rest is just extra."

But I looked at him—at this boy, this captain, this god-in-becoming who had just fought an Admiral to a standstill and was now sitting on the deck of his ship worrying about whether he was still himself—and I could not summon the words.

Because he was right, in a way that cut beneath philosophy to something more fundamental.

I was crew. Whatever else I was—torturer, autarch, vessel of dead memories, stranger from a dying world—I was also crew. And that identity, that role, that *relationship*, was not negated by the uncertainties that plagued me. It existed alongside them. Coexisted. Provided a foundation on which to stand even when the other foundations crumbled.

"You're annoyingly wise sometimes," I said.

Luffy laughed. "Shishishi! Nami says the same thing. She says I'm stupid in a smart way."

"That is... one way to put it."

"I'm hungry. Is there meat?"

---

(I do not know if this conversation redeems me.

I have written throughout this account of my failures—my failure to save Thecla, my failure to bring the New Sun without drowning millions, my failure to understand the world I was born into or the world I have come to inhabit. I have presented myself as a man shaped by guilt, driven by uncertainty, seeking redemption in service to a cause I did not choose.

But the reader should not trust this presentation entirely.

The man who narrates is also the man who acted, and the man who acted was not always as noble, as thoughtful, as tortured as the narrator might suggest. There were moments of pettiness I have glossed over. Moments of cowardice I have reframed as caution. Moments when my actions served no purpose but my own comfort, and I have described them as though they served something larger.

This is not deliberate deception. It is simply what happens when a self describes itself. We cannot help but edit. We cannot help but shape. The story we tell about ourselves is always more coherent than the life we actually lived—because coherence is the nature of story, and life is something messier, something that resists the patterns we try to impose upon it.

I tell you this not to excuse myself but to warn you. Read with skepticism. Note the gaps, the elisions, the moments where the narrator seems too wise, too self-aware, too perfectly positioned to learn the lessons the narrative is teaching.

Those moments are where the truth is most distorted.

Those moments are where I am most fully lying without knowing that I lie.)

---

We sail on.

The sea spreads before us, blue and endless, carrying us toward Elbaf and the final Poneglyph and whatever waits beyond. Luffy sits on the figurehead, laughing at something only he can see. Robin reads in her library. Zoro trains in the crow's nest. Nami charts our course through waters no map has ever recorded.

And I stand at the stern, watching the wake, wondering what it means that a god has chosen to wear the face of an idiot, and whether the sun that laughs is kinder than the sun that drowns, and whether any of us—mortal or divine, human or whatever I have become—can know ourselves truly, or only approximate knowledge through the imperfect medium of narrative.

The drums beat, somewhere, in a rhythm that might be Joy Boy's heartbeat or might be the pulse of the sea itself or might be nothing at all, a pattern I have imposed on random noise because patterns are what minds do, what narrators do, what anyone does who tries to make sense of the senseless flood of experience.

I am Severian. I am Thecla. I am the Autarch of a Commonwealth that no longer exists, the torturer of a guild whose purpose I have abandoned, the crewmate of a pirate whose divinity I am only beginning to understand.

I am all of these things, and none of them, and the question of which is truest is a question I can no longer answer—if I ever could.

The sea watches. The sun laughs.

And the story continues, whether or not I am reliable enough to tell it.

---

*Postscript:*

I read over what I have written and I find I have contradicted myself at least three times regarding my emotional state, twice regarding the sequence of events, and once regarding whether Zoro was drinking during our conversation.

I could revise. I could smooth the contradictions, create the appearance of consistency.

I choose not to.

Let the contradictions stand. They are, perhaps, the truest thing in this account.
