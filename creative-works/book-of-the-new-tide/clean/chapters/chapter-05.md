# Chapter Five: The God Who Was Not

I have set down in an earlier passage that I felt, as our ship rose toward Skypiea, the presence of the Increate watching. I must now qualify this statement, for in the light of what followed I am no longer certain that what I felt was the Increate at all—or rather, I am no longer certain that the Increate is what I believed it to be.

The theologians of the Commonwealth taught that the Increate was that which existed before existence, the uncaused cause, the will behind all wills. It could not be perceived directly, they said, any more than the eye can see itself; we knew it only through its effects, its interventions, the subtle pressures it exerted upon the course of events. To feel its presence was to feel the weight of meaning itself, the sense that one's actions mattered in some ultimate register beyond the merely personal.

What I felt as we ascended was something like that. But it was also something else—something localized, something *watching* in a way that implied eyes, attention, the focused awareness of a specific consciousness. The Increate, if it existed, would not need to watch; it would simply *know*, as the sea knows the shape of the shore without needing to observe it. Whatever regarded us from the clouds above was not omniscient. It was merely powerful.

I did not share this observation with my crewmates. They were occupied with more immediate concerns: the Knock-Up Stream that had carried us upward was dissipating, and Nami was shouting instructions as the Merry threatened to tip sideways into the endless fall below. Usopp was screaming—he screamed often; I had grown accustomed to it—and Luffy was laughing with the pure delight of a child on a carnival ride. Only Robin seemed calm, her dark eyes fixed on the clouds above with an expression I recognized: the scholar's hunger, the need to *know* that transcended fear.

We broke through the cloud layer like a fish leaping from water, and suddenly there was ground beneath us—if ground it could be called. The clouds here were solid, dense enough to walk upon, and upon them grew trees and flowers of varieties I had never seen, their roots anchored in vapor as firmly as any forest of the Commonwealth anchored itself in soil.

"Island clouds," Nami breathed. "I read about them, but I never..."

She did not finish. None of us could find words adequate to the strangeness.

---

The people of Skypiea called earth *vearth*, and they spoke of it with a reverence that reminded me of how the autochthons of the southern reaches spoke of water. To them, soil was sacred—the rarest of substances, found only in fragments that had somehow made their way to the sky islands over centuries of isolation. They built shrines around patches of dirt no larger than a man's hand. They fought wars over deposits of clay. A flower grown in true earth was worth more than gold, more than gems, more than the strange shells they used as currency.

I understood this. I had seen how value inverts when scarcity changes—how the things we take for granted become precious when we can no longer assume their presence. In the Citadel, we had taken death for granted; it was our stock in trade, as common as bread. But life, true life, the vitality that resisted our ministrations—that was rare, and we valued it accordingly, though we could never admit as much.

The Skypieans welcomed us warily. We were surface-dwellers, *Blue Sea people* in their parlance, and our arrival was an anomaly that disrupted their careful social order. They directed us to a place called Angel Island, where visitors were processed and taxed, and where we first encountered the system of governance that would soon bring us into conflict with their ruler.

For Skypiea had a god.

Not a god in the metaphorical sense—not a revered leader or a hereditary monarch styled with divine titles. Their god was, they insisted, an actual deity: omniscient, omnipotent, dwelling in a realm called Upper Yard from which he observed all that transpired in his domain. He knew their thoughts. He heard their prayers. He struck down blasphemers with lightning called forth from clear skies.

His name was Enel.

---

I should record here that I did not believe in Enel's divinity for a single moment.

This was not skepticism born of rationalism—I had seen too much in my life to dismiss the numinous out of hand. I had carried the Claw of the Conciliator, which healed the sick and raised the dead. I had spoken with the Hierogrammates, beings so far beyond humanity that divinity seemed an inadequate descriptor. I had felt the presence of the Increate itself, or what I took to be the Increate, pressing upon my consciousness like a hand upon a dreamer's shoulder.

I knew what holiness felt like. Enel did not feel holy.

What he felt like—what I perceived when I extended my Observation Haki toward the place called Upper Yard—was *will*. Vast, yes. Powerful, certainly. But it was a human will, or something that had once been human, swollen to monstrous proportions through the acquisition of power but fundamentally unchanged in its nature. Enel wanted what all tyrants want: obedience, worship, the confirmation of his own supremacy. His desires were legible to me because I had seen them before, in the petty lords of the House Absolute, in the revolutionary Vodalus, in the mirror when I had sat upon the Phoenix Throne.

He was a man who had mistaken power for divinity. The most dangerous kind of man.

"You feel it too," Robin said to me that evening, as we camped on the shores of a cloud-lake that reflected stars I did not recognize. "Something is wrong here."

"The god is false."

"More than that." She was consulting one of her books—she had salvaged several from the wreck of our first ship, and guarded them with a jealousy I respected. "The history is wrong. According to my research, Skypiea has only had a 'god' for six years. Before that, they had a different system entirely—and before *that*, there was a war between the original Skypieans and another people called the Shandians."

"What happened to the Shandians?"

"They were driven out. Conquered. Their homeland—Upper Yard—was claimed first by the Skypieans and then by Enel when he arrived and overthrew the previous ruler." She closed her book with a snap. "But that's not the interesting part. The interesting part is *where* Upper Yard came from."

"Tell me."

"It rose from the Blue Sea. Two hundred years ago, a massive Knock-Up Stream carried an entire island into the sky—an island that, according to legend, contained one of the Poneglyphs. One of the stones that records the true history of the Void Century." Her eyes gleamed with that scholar's hunger I had noticed before. "That's why I'm here, Severian. Not for treasure, not for adventure. For *knowledge*. For the truth that has been hidden for eight hundred years."

I thought of the brown books in the Citadel's library, those repositories of knowledge too dangerous or too heretical for common consumption. I thought of Father Inire's secrets, of the Hierogrammates' manipulations, of all the truths that had been concealed from me until I stumbled upon them by accident or design.

"Then we must find this Poneglyph," I said.

"Yes." She smiled, and for the first time I saw in her expression something other than scholarly detachment. I saw *hope*. "We must."

---

The events that followed have been recorded elsewhere in greater detail than I can provide here, for I was not present at all of them and must rely on the accounts of my crewmates for portions of the narrative. I shall summarize what is essential and dwell only on those moments that bear directly upon my own journey.

Enel's power derived from a Devil Fruit—the Rumble-Rumble Fruit, which had transformed him into lightning itself. Like Crocodile in the desert, he was Logia: elemental, intangible, apparently invincible. But where Crocodile had been sand, slow and grinding, Enel was electricity—faster than thought, hotter than any flame, capable of striking from any distance with force sufficient to level cities.

And he had developed his Observation Haki to a degree I had not imagined possible.

He called it Mantra, as the Skypieans did, but it was the same faculty I had begun to cultivate: the perception of presence, of intention, of the shape of wills in the world. Enel had extended his Mantra across the entirety of Skypiea; he could hear every conversation, perceive every thought, strike down anyone who defied him from kilometers away. This was the foundation of his godhood—not mere power but *knowledge*, the appearance of omniscience created through the systematic application of a sense his subjects did not know they lacked.

I recognized the technique. The guild had employed something similar, though cruder: informants, surveillance, the careful cultivation of fear that made subjects police themselves. Enel had simply refined the method to its logical extreme. He did not need informants because he could hear everything directly. He did not need to cultivate fear because his lightning made examples unnecessary.

And yet.

And yet his Mantra, vast as it was, had limits. It could perceive intention but not compel it. It could anticipate action but not prevent it absolutely. And most crucially, it could be *resisted* by a will of sufficient strength.

I discovered this when his lightning first struck me.

---

We had entered Upper Yard against Enel's explicit prohibition, seeking the Poneglyph Robin believed was hidden somewhere in that sky-bound jungle. The forest there was like nothing I had seen—trees larger than the towers of the Citadel, their trunks broader than the span of ten men's arms, their canopy so thick that the sky above was reduced to scattered fragments of blue glimpsed through endless green. Creatures moved in those trees, beasts that had evolved in isolation for centuries and owed no allegiance to the forms I knew from Urth.

We separated—foolishly, I now recognize, but Luffy's approach to exploration did not admit of caution. He and Zoro went one way; Nami, Usopp, and Sanji another; Robin and I proceeded together, following her intuition toward the Poneglyph's likely location.

It was midway through the second day when Enel's priest found us.

He called himself Ohm, and he was one of the four enforcers who served as Enel's instruments of judgment. His weapon was a blade that could change shape—extending, contracting, curving in ways that defied the properties of ordinary steel. His Mantra was well-developed, perhaps not to Enel's extent but sufficient to anticipate attacks before they were launched. And his will was the cold, focused will of a fanatic, a man who had subordinated his own desires entirely to his god's purpose.

I drew Terminus Est.

The battle that followed was unlike any I had fought since leaving Urth. The priest's shape-changing blade forced me to abandon the forms the guild had taught, which relied on predicting an opponent's reach and timing; I could not predict what his sword would do because it could do anything. Instead I fell back on the Observation Haki I had been cultivating, perceiving his intentions rather than his actions, feeling the moment before each strike and responding not to what he did but to what he *meant* to do.

We were evenly matched—or so I believed, until I felt the third presence.

Enel was watching.

Not physically present, not manifested in any form I could see—but his Mantra had found us, had locked onto our battle, and I could feel his attention like the sun's heat on bare skin. He was amused, I realized. We were entertainment to him, insects fighting for his diversion.

And then the lightning fell.

I cannot describe what it is to be struck by the wrath of a god, even a false one. The poets of the Commonwealth spoke of divine chastisement in terms of fire and light, but they had never experienced the reality. The bolt that descended upon me was not fire—it was *force*, unmediated and absolute, the direct imposition of one will upon another. It said: *You are nothing. I am everything. Submit.*

I did not submit.

I do not fully understand what happened in that moment. Perhaps my Conqueror's Haki rose in instinctive response; perhaps the will I had cultivated through years of discipline simply refused to bend; perhaps whatever the Claw had done to me, whatever transformation I had undergone in becoming the vessel of the New Sun, rendered me resistant to such assaults in ways I could not consciously comprehend.

The lightning struck me. It hurt—Increate, how it hurt—but I did not fall. My muscles spasmed, my vision whited out, the smell of burning filled my nostrils. But I remained standing.

And I felt, across the vast distance that separated us, Enel's surprise.

He struck again. And again. Each bolt was agony beyond description, but each time I remained conscious, remained *present*, my will refusing to be extinguished. Ohm had frozen, staring at me with an expression I recognized from clients in the third level of our oubliette—the expression of a man whose understanding of reality has just been fundamentally violated.

I raised Terminus Est.

"Your god," I said, my voice a rasp of scorched tissue, "is not a god."

The blade fell. Ohm's shape-changing sword intercepted it, but Terminus Est was not a shape-changing sword—she was a blade forged for one purpose, weighted with mercury to deliver strokes no arm alone could match, and she had taken the heads of saints and sinners alike across centuries of service. The priest's weapon shattered.

I did not kill him. Perhaps I should have; he would have killed me without hesitation had our positions been reversed. But something stayed my hand—some echo of the mercy I had learned to give in those rare cases when the Autarch's judgment permitted, or perhaps merely the recognition that this man was a victim as much as a perpetrator, his devotion to a false god a cage from which he could not perceive the bars.

I struck him with the flat of the blade instead, and he crumpled.

Robin emerged from the undergrowth where she had taken cover. Her expression was unreadable.

"He'll send more," she said.

"Yes."

"Can you do that again? Survive his lightning?"

I considered the question honestly. My body was a ruin of burns and nerve damage; only my will was keeping me upright. I could feel the Claw's old gift stirring in my flesh, beginning the slow work of healing that had sustained me through injuries that should have been fatal. But I did not know how many more strikes I could endure before even that gift failed.

"I do not know," I said. "But I do not think he expected anyone to survive even once."

"No." A small smile touched her lips. "He didn't."

---

The Poneglyph was located in the ruins of a city called Shandora.

Robin found it as she found all such things—through patience, scholarship, and an intuition honed by years of searching for the fragments of erased history. It stood at the heart of the golden city, a massive stone inscribed with the characters only she could read, surrounded by the bones of a civilization that had been destroyed four hundred years before the island rose into the sky.

I stood guard while she worked, my senses extended to their limits, watching for the next assault that I knew must come. But Enel did not strike again—not yet. He was waiting, I realized. Gathering his strength, perhaps, or simply savoring the anticipation. False gods, in my experience, are prone to theatricality.

"It speaks of a weapon," Robin said at last, her voice strange. "An ancient weapon called Poseidon. It's not here—the Poneglyph doesn't give its location—but it confirms the weapon exists. And it speaks of something else."

"What?"

"A name. A people." She traced the inscriptions with her fingertips, her expression distant. "The people who built this city, who created the Poneglyphs, who fought against whatever force would become the World Government eight hundred years ago. They called themselves..." She paused, and I saw her lips form a word I did not recognize.

"What does it mean?"

"I don't know yet. But I think—" She stopped. Her eyes had gone wide.

I felt it too: the gathering charge in the air, the static that lifted the hairs on my arms, the pressure of a will preparing to strike with everything it had.

"He's coming," I said.

"No." Robin shook her head slowly. "Not coming. *Descending*."

I looked up.

The clouds above were parting. Through the gap, I could see a shape—a ship, but not a ship of water; a ship of the air, vast and golden, its prow carved in the likeness of an ark from ancient legend. And standing upon its deck, silhouetted against the light of the sun that burned so much brighter here in the sky than it ever had on the surface...

Enel.

He was not what I had expected. I had imagined something monstrous, perhaps—a figure twisted by power into inhuman shape, like Baldanders in his growth or the cacogens in their alienness. But Enel was beautiful, in the way that certain exultants of the House Absolute had been beautiful: tall, lean, his features regular and aristocratic, his smile the smile of a man who has never encountered anything he could not destroy.

His ears were impossibly long, stretched by ornaments into loops that hung past his shoulders. His chest was bare, his body unmarked by labor or battle. He looked, I realized, like a statue of a god—idealized, symmetrical, perfect.

"You survived," he said, and his voice carried without effort, resonant with the crackle of barely-contained lightning. "Interesting. No one has ever survived before."

"You are not a god," I said. It was not defiance; it was simple statement of fact.

"No?" He tilted his head, amused. "Then what am I?"

"A man who has eaten a Devil Fruit and developed his Haki to unusual degree. Powerful, yes. Rare, certainly. But not divine."

"And what is divinity, surface-dweller, if not power sufficient to shape the world according to one's will?" He descended from the ark, walking on air itself—on the electrical field he generated, I realized, his Logia nature rendering even gravity a suggestion rather than a law. "I hear every voice in this land. I know every thought. I grant life and death with a gesture. What god does more?"

"The Increate," I said, "does not need to convince anyone of its divinity. It simply *is*. You require worship. You require acknowledgment. You strike down those who deny you because their denial threatens the fiction upon which your power rests. A true god would be indifferent to such denials. They could not diminish it."

For a moment—just a moment—something flickered in his eyes. Not doubt, exactly, but the shadow of a question he had never allowed himself to ask.

Then it was gone, replaced by cold fury.

"I am going to destroy this island," he said. "I have always intended to. Skypiea is merely a stepping stone—a place to gather the gold I need, to build the ark that will carry me to the Fairy Vearth, the endless land in the sky where I will create a kingdom worthy of my nature. But I had planned to leave some survivors, to carry the story of my godhood to the Blue Sea below." His smile returned, but it was no longer amused. "Now I think I will leave none. Your defiance has cost your people their future, surface-dweller."

He raised his hand.

I felt the charge building, felt the entirety of his will focusing into a single point, preparing to discharge with force sufficient to—

Luffy hit him in the face.

---

I have seen many battles. I have witnessed the clash of armies in the war that consumed the north of the Commonwealth, seen the autarch's forces engage the rebel legions in engagements that left thousands dead. I watched, from a distance, the Hierogrammates manipulate the very fabric of time to achieve their ends.

None of it prepared me for the fight between Luffy and Enel.

It was not merely a contest of strength, though both were strong beyond any reasonable measure. It was not merely a clash of techniques, though both had mastered their respective powers to degrees that bordered on the absolute. It was a collision of *cosmologies*—two irreconcilable visions of what the world was and what it should be, hammering against each other with force sufficient to reshape the sky itself.

Enel believed in hierarchy. In a universe ordered by power, where the strong ruled and the weak submitted and any deviation from this natural law was aberration to be corrected. His godhood was simply the logical extension of this belief: he was strongest, therefore he was god, therefore his will was law.

Luffy believed in freedom. Not freedom as abstraction, not freedom as political philosophy, but freedom as fundamental fact—the irreducible right of every being to pursue their own will, constrained only by the equal right of others. His dream of becoming Pirate King was not a dream of dominion but of *capacity*: the strength to go anywhere, do anything, protect anyone, without asking permission from those who would deny him.

These beliefs could not coexist. The universe was not large enough for both.

And so they fought.

Enel's lightning could not harm Luffy—the rubber of his transformed body rendered him immune to electrical damage, a fact that seemed to genuinely surprise the self-proclaimed god. But Enel was not merely lightning; he was also fast, and clever, and possessed of a Mantra that let him anticipate Luffy's attacks before they were launched. He dodged, he weaved, he counterattacked with waves of electrical force that, while they could not injure Luffy directly, could superheat the air around him, melt the ground beneath his feet, turn the battlefield itself into a weapon.

Luffy pressed forward regardless. He stretched, he compressed, he launched himself across impossible distances to deliver punches that would have shattered mountains. Each blow that landed sent Enel reeling, his intangible lightning-body forced into solidity by the sheer force of impact. Each miss gave Enel an opening to retaliate, to rain destruction upon the jungle below, to threaten the crewmates who had gathered to watch the impossible battle.

I wanted to help. I raised Terminus Est, prepared to enter the fray—but Robin's hand on my arm stopped me.

"This isn't our fight," she said.

"They're destroying everything."

"Yes. And one of them will win." Her eyes were fixed on the combatants, calculating. "If we intervene now, we might tip the balance—but we might also disrupt whatever Luffy is trying to do. He needs to win this himself. He needs to *prove* that his will is stronger."

"And if he fails?"

"Then we run." She said it without shame. "We take the knowledge I've gathered and we flee, and we hope that someone, someday, can use what we've learned to defeat Enel or whoever inherits his power."

"That is cold calculus."

"I'm an archaeologist. We deal in long timescales." She smiled, and it was a sad smile, the smile of a woman who had lost too much to believe in certain victories. "But I don't think he'll fail. Do you?"

I watched Luffy fighting. I saw the grin on his face—that impossible, inextinguishable grin that seemed to burn brighter the more desperate the battle became. I felt his will blazing like a sun, undimmed by injury or exhaustion or the apparent hopelessness of his situation.

"No," I said. "I do not think he will fail."

---

The battle's climax came at the summit of the giant beanstalk that grew at Upper Yard's heart.

I was not present—I learned the details later from Nami and Usopp, who had somehow ascended in the Merry herself, riding the knock-up stream of air that the battle's destruction had generated. But I felt it, even from the ground below. I felt the moment when Luffy's fist connected with Enel's face for the final time, imbued with every ounce of his Haki, every fragment of his unbreakable will.

I felt the golden bell ring.

It was the bell of Shandora, the ancient city—the bell that had been silent for four hundred years, since the island rose into the sky and the civilization that built it was shattered by forces they could not resist. The Shandians had been ringing it, generation after generation, as a signal to their descendants on the Blue Sea below: *We are still here. We did not perish. The sky has not consumed us.*

And now it rang again, its voice carrying across the clouds, across the void between earth and sky, a declaration that echoed Luffy's own impossible promise:

*I am here. I am free. And I will not be silenced.*

Enel fell. His ark fell with him, crashing into the clouds, its golden hull splitting open to spill treasure across the sky. The self-proclaimed god plummeted toward the Blue Sea so far below, his lightning flickering and fading as unconsciousness claimed him, his divinity revealed as the fiction it had always been.

And above, silhouetted against the sun, Luffy laughed.

---

We left Skypiea three days later, our ship laden with gold and our hearts with memories stranger than gold. The Skypieans and Shandians had made peace, united by the ringing of the bell and the fall of the tyrant who had oppressed them both. Robin had transcribed the Poneglyph's contents into her notebooks. Chopper had learned new medicines from the sky island's unique flora. Even Nami's maps had grown, expanded by the cartography of clouds.

And I...

I stood at the stern as we descended, watching the sky islands shrink to specks and then to nothing, and I thought about gods.

Enel had been powerful. More powerful than any single individual I had encountered in this world, save perhaps the distant figures of the Admirals and Emperors that my crewmates spoke of with wary respect. His Devil Fruit had made him elemental; his Haki had made him omniscient within his domain; his will had shaped an entire civilization around the worship of his false divinity.

And Luffy had beaten him with his fists.

Not through superior power—Enel's lightning could have incinerated a continent if properly directed. Not through superior technique—Luffy's fighting style was crude, improvisational, almost childish in its directness. Not even through the lucky accident of his rubber immunity, though that had certainly helped.

He had won because his will was stronger. Because he wanted freedom more than Enel wanted godhood. Because at the fundamental level where Haki operated, where intention became force, Luffy's dream was simply *bigger* than his opponent's.

The Increate, I had told Enel, does not need to convince anyone of its divinity.

But perhaps I had been wrong. Perhaps the Increate—if it existed—convinced through demonstration rather than argument. Perhaps its divinity manifested not in power over others but in the capacity to *inspire*, to kindle wills that might otherwise gutter and die, to remind the weak that strength was possible and the enslaved that freedom was real.

If that was divinity, then Luffy was closer to godhood than Enel had ever been.

And I—I who had served a dying sun, who had carried the hope of a New Sun without understanding what I carried—what was I?

The sea spread before us, blue and endless, pregnant with islands we had not yet seen and enemies we had not yet faced. Somewhere ahead lay the great powers of this world: the Admirals in their fortress of justice, the Emperors in their territories of chaos, the shadowy figures who pulled strings from behind the World Government's facade. Somewhere ahead lay the One Piece, the treasure that would crown whoever found it King of the Pirates.

And somewhere, perhaps, lay the answer to the question that had plagued me since I first arrived in this world:

Why was I here?

I did not know. But for the first time, I found that the not-knowing did not trouble me.

I had a crew. I had a purpose, even if that purpose was simply to sail toward whatever horizon my captain chose. I had my blade and my memories and the strange gifts that Urth had given me, and I had the growing suspicion that my presence in this world was not accident but design—that someone or something had placed me here for reasons I would only understand in the fullness of time.

The wind caught our sails. The Merry leaped forward, eager as a hound on a scent.

And I, Severian the Lame, once Autarch of the Commonwealth, now a pirate of the Grand Line, let the horizon swallow my doubts and carry me forward into whatever came next.

---

In the chapters that follow, I shall record our encounters with the powers of the sea: the Marine fortress of Enies Lobby, where Robin's past caught up with her and we declared war upon the world; the underwater prison of Impel Down, whose tortures taught me that even I had more to learn of suffering; and the great battle of Marineford, where I saw a man die to save his brother and understood at last what Luffy meant by freedom.

But first I must tell of the shipwright called Franky and the musician called Brook, and of how our crew grew by two members who were, each in their own way, as strange as I.

The sea called.

We answered.
