# Chapter Thirteen: The Sun That Laughs

I have learned something that I cannot unlearn.

The reader who has followed my account thus far will note that I have spoken often of Luffy—of his will, his certainty, his capacity to bend the world through sheer refusal to accept its refusals. I have written of him as a man of extraordinary determination, as a captain whose simplicity conceals depths I could not fully fathom, as a practitioner of the theology of will that I found both inspiring and troubling.

I was wrong.

Not wrong to admire him. Not wrong to follow him. But wrong in my fundamental categorization—wrong in a way that has reshaped everything I thought I understood about this world, about my purpose within it, and about the nature of the power I have spent my life seeking to comprehend.

Luffy is not merely a man with a Devil Fruit.

Luffy is a god. Or the vessel of a god. Or the inheritor of a name that has been waiting eight hundred years for someone worthy to carry it.

He is the Sun God Nika.

And I—I who was born to bring the New Sun to a world that had forgotten light—find myself sailing in the wake of a sun that laughs.

---

Let me set down what I have learned, in the order I learned it.

It began at Wano, though I did not understand its significance at the time. Luffy had been defeated—truly defeated, in a way I had not seen before, his body broken by the Emperor called Kaido, his heartbeat stilled to silence. I felt it through my Observation Haki: the flame that was Luffy, that impossible bonfire of will I had come to rely upon as one relies upon the sun itself, guttering and going dark.

I thought he had died.

I was preparing myself for that reality—for the grief, for the question of what remained when the captain fell, for the cold future of a crew without its center—when I felt something else. A pulse. Not the restart of a stopped heart, not the recovery of a body pushed beyond its limits. Something stranger. Something *new*.

The drums.

They began in my perception as a rhythm, distant and sourceless, like the heartbeat of the world itself deciding to make itself heard. And they grew—grew until the air itself seemed to pulse with them, until the very stones of Onigashima vibrated in sympathy, until I understood that what I was hearing was not metaphor but *reality*: a sound that was changing the nature of existence around it.

And then Luffy rose.

But the Luffy who rose was not the Luffy who had fallen. His hair had turned white. His eyes had become rings of joy in a face that seemed barely able to contain its own delight. And he moved—not as rubber moves, stretching and snapping, but as *imagination* moves, unconstrained by physics, unbound by the rules that govern ordinary flesh.

He made the ground itself into rubber. He reached into his enemy's body and made the *interior* of Kaido elastic. He grabbed lightning from the sky and bent it to his will. He laughed—a laugh that was not merely sound but *force*, a laugh that rewrote reality in its immediate vicinity.

I watched a god wake up.

---

The explanation came later, in fragments, from sources I am still learning to evaluate.

The fruit Luffy ate as a child was not, as the world believed, the Gum-Gum Fruit. That was a name the World Government had assigned to it—a deliberate misdirection, a lie maintained for eight centuries to obscure the fruit's true nature. The real name was older, stranger, heavier with implication:

The Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika.

A Mythical Zoan. A fruit that transforms its eater not into an animal but into a *legend*—into the figure that the slaves of ancient times had prayed to, had whispered about in their chains, had dreamed of as the liberator who would come dancing and laughing to break their bondage.

The Sun God.

The World Government had hunted this fruit for eight hundred years. They had killed to keep it from awakening. They had built their entire apparatus of control—the Marines, the Cipher Pol, the erasure of the Void Century itself—in part to ensure that no one would ever again become what Luffy has now become.

And it found him anyway. Found a boy in a small village in the East Blue. Found the grandson of a Marine legend and the son of a revolutionary. Found someone whose will was so perfectly aligned with the fruit's nature that when the awakening finally came, the god and the man became indistinguishable.

Joy Boy has returned.

I do not fully understand who Joy Boy was—the histories have been too thoroughly erased, and even Robin's scholarship can only reconstruct fragments. But I know this much: he was the first to carry this power, eight hundred years ago, before the Great Kingdom fell. He made a promise to someone—to the world, perhaps, or to some specific being—and he failed to keep that promise. And in failing, he left behind a will that has been waiting, patient as stone, for someone capable of carrying it forward.

Luffy is that someone.

The drum that beats in his chest is Joy Boy's heartbeat, reaching across centuries. The laugh that rewrites reality is Joy Boy's joy, finally finding a vessel sufficient to contain it. The sun that rises in this world—the sun that will burn away the eight hundred years of darkness and lies—

It was never going to be me.

---

I must confess that this realization struck me harder than I expected.

I have written of my purpose in this world—of the Poneglyph that knew my name, of the gardeners who told me I was here to help the one who would face the final choice. I accepted this role. I was, I think, even grateful for it: to be essential without being central, to serve without ruling, to contribute to a victory that would not be solely mine.

But there was, I now recognize, a pride beneath my acceptance. A quiet assumption that the work I did in my world—the carrying of the Claw, the bringing of the New Sun—had made me uniquely qualified for this one. That I understood something about solar theology that this world lacked. That my experience with dying and renewing light gave me a perspective Luffy would need, could not obtain elsewhere, would be incomplete without.

And now I learn that he is the Sun God.

That he has been the Sun God all along, from before I arrived, from before he knew it himself. That the power I was meant to help him achieve is power he already possesses, waiting only to awaken. That my role is not to bring him knowledge he lacks but simply to... what? Bear witness? Offer support? Play the companion to a divinity that does not need me to be divine?

This is petty. I recognize its pettiness as I write it. A man should not resent learning that the cosmos does not center on him. A man who has already failed to bring one sun—who watched Urth drown beneath the light he summoned, who carries the deaths of millions as the price of his world's renewal—should not begrudge another the chance to succeed where he fell short.

And yet the feeling persists. Not resentment, exactly. Something closer to grief. The grief of discovering that the story you thought you were in is not the story being told.

---

I have watched Luffy use this power now, several times.

At Wano, against Kaido. At Egghead, against the horrors the World Government sent to destroy us. Each time, I observe with the dual attention of a fellow combatant and a theologian: noting the tactical applications, yes, but also the *texture* of the divinity, the particular flavor of this godhood compared to others I have encountered.

And what I notice most is the joy.

The Increate of my world, whatever else it was, was not joyful. It was vast, patient, purposeful—but its purposes were terrible as well as magnificent. The New Sun that I summoned drowned continents. The mercy of the Conciliator came wrapped in suffering. The theology I learned was one of sacrifice, of cost, of prices paid in blood for blessings whose full value would only be realized by future generations.

Nika is different.

Nika *laughs*. Nika dances. Nika transforms the most desperate battle into something that resembles—I struggle to find the right word—*play*. Luffy in his awakened form does not merely defeat his enemies; he makes their defeat absurd, cartoonish, as though the universe itself is telling a joke at their expense. His body stretches into impossible shapes. His face contorts into expressions that should not exist on human features. He becomes, in those moments, something between a warrior and a performer, between a hero and a comedian.

And yet the power is real. The enemies fall. The slaves are freed. The laughter is not impotent but *effective*—a force that reshapes reality as surely as any sword stroke, any act of will.

I do not know what to do with a god who laughs.

The gods of my world did not laugh. They demanded, judged, blessed, cursed—but they did not find existence *funny*. The cosmos, in my theology, was heavy with significance, every moment freighted with meaning, every choice weighted with eternal consequence.

But Nika treats existence as a game. Not trivially—I have seen Luffy's face in moments of genuine grief, genuine fury, genuine determination. He is not indifferent to suffering. But beneath the suffering, beneath the struggle, there is an irrepressible delight in being alive, in acting, in confronting impossibility with the laughing certainty that impossibility is just another obstacle to be punched through.

This is a theology I do not know how to inhabit.

---

And then there is Egghead.

I must write of Egghead, though the memories are fresh enough to wound.

The island was the laboratory of Vegapunk—the scientist whose genius had shaped the World Government's technology for decades. We went there seeking knowledge, as we always seek knowledge, and we found more than we bargained for. We found the truth.

Not all of it. Not yet. But enough.

Vegapunk knew things about the Void Century that even Robin had not uncovered. He had studied the ancient technologies, had reverse-engineered fragments of the Great Kingdom's science, had come to understand—dimly, imperfectly, but genuinely—what had been lost when the World Government rose to power. And as he faced his own death—for the Government had decided he knew too much, had lived too long, had become a liability rather than an asset—he chose to share that knowledge with the world.

A broadcast. Sent to every receiver capable of receiving it. Vegapunk's voice, speaking from beyond death, telling the world what had been hidden for eight centuries.

The seas will rise.

This is what he said, among other revelations. The seas of this world are rising, have been rising slowly for centuries, will continue to rise until the islands that remain are drowned beneath the waters. The World Government knows this. They have always known. Their entire project—the control, the erasure, the eight hundred years of maintained ignorance—has been in service of managing this inevitable catastrophe in a way that preserves their power.

And there is a way to stop it. Or to reverse it. Something the ancient kingdom knew, something encoded in the Poneglyphs, something that Luffy—as Joy Boy's heir—may be able to achieve.

But only if the Government does not stop him first.

---

I watched them try to stop him at Egghead.

The Five Elders came in person—the Gorosei, those ancient figures who sit at the apex of the World Government's hierarchy, who have ruled for longer than their apparent ages should permit. I had heard of them, but I had not *seen* them. Had not understood what they were.

They are not human.

Or they are no longer human, if they ever were. When pressed, when threatened, when Luffy's awakened power pushed against their control, they *transformed*. Became monsters—vast, mythological, terrible. Beasts out of nightmare, out of legend, out of the same ancient past that produced Joy Boy and the Great Kingdom and all the other wonders that the World Government has spent eight centuries trying to bury.

I fought them. Stood alongside my crewmates as these things—these *Elders* who present themselves to the world as dignified administrators—revealed their true nature and tried to destroy us all. Terminus Est cut their flesh, but they regenerated. My Haki pushed against their will, but their wills were ancient, reinforced by centuries of dominion, and they did not buckle as ordinary enemies buckle.

We escaped. Barely. With losses I am still accounting for.

But we survived, and the broadcast went out, and the world heard Vegapunk's voice telling them that everything they believed was a lie.

---

There is a throne, I have learned.

In the Holy Land of Mariejois, in the seat of the World Government's power, there is an empty throne that sits at the center of their authority. The rulers of the world's nations gather before it, swear fealty to the principles it represents, acknowledge that no single person should sit upon it—that power is shared, distributed, held in trust for the common good.

The throne is not empty.

Someone sits upon it. Has sat upon it for eight hundred years, perhaps longer. A figure called Imu, whose existence is known only to the Gorosei, whose will shapes the world from behind curtains of secrecy so thick that even most of the Government's own servants do not know they have a master.

Imu is the shadow behind the shadow. Imu is the one who ordered Ohara's destruction, who marked Robin for death when she was still a child, who has been hunting the Sun God's fruit and its wielders since the dawn of the current age. Imu is, perhaps, the one who killed Joy Boy—or the heir of those who killed him.

And Luffy is sailing toward a confrontation with this being.

Not yet. There are islands between here and there, challenges yet to face, pieces of the truth yet to uncover. But the trajectory is clear. The Sun God and the King of Shadows are on a collision course, and when they meet, the result will determine whether this world drowns or rises.

---

I find myself thinking of my own sun.

The New Sun I brought to Urth was not a laughing thing. It was a white fountain, a renewal purchased at apocalyptic cost. When it rose, the glaciers melted; when they melted, the seas rose; when the seas rose, millions drowned. I had been warned this would happen. I had accepted the price as necessary. I had told myself that the world that emerged would be worth the world that was lost.

But I had never watched it happen. The Hierogrammates showed me the aftermath—Ushas, the new Urth, green and flourishing and populated by descendants who did not remember the Deluge. They did not show me the drowning. They did not show me the mothers holding their children as the waters rose, the cities swallowed, the civilizations ending not with conquest but with slow, inexorable flood.

Vegapunk says this world's seas are rising too.

And Luffy—the Sun God who laughs—may be the one to stop them. Or reverse them. Or do something that I, with my sun-scarred understanding, cannot yet imagine.

I am jealous of him. I confess it. Jealous of a god who might save without drowning, who might bring light without burning, who might renew without requiring the deaths of millions as the price of renewal.

But I am also hopeful. For the first time since I arrived in this world, I am hopeful in a way that does not feel like self-deception.

Because if Nika can do what the New Sun could not—if there is a way to save without destroying, to heal without first killing—then perhaps my theology was always incomplete. Perhaps the Increate I served was only one face of something larger. Perhaps the divine comes in forms I had not imagined: stern and sorrowful, yes, but also laughing and dancing and treating the apocalypse itself as a problem to be solved rather than a tragedy to be endured.

Perhaps Joy Boy knew something that the Hierogrammates did not.

Perhaps the sun that laughs is the sun that saves.

---

We sail now toward Elbaf, the island of giants.

Robin believes there is a Poneglyph there—perhaps the final Road Poneglyph, the last piece needed to locate Laugh Tale and the treasure that waits at the end of all seas. Luffy is eager, as he is always eager, his awakened divinity adding an edge of cosmic absurdity to his usual enthusiasm. He speaks of the treasure not as wealth to be gained but as a *joke* waiting for him—as though Roger, the previous King, left something hilarious at the end of the Grand Line and he cannot wait to be in on it.

Perhaps that is what it is. Perhaps the One Piece is literally a joke. Perhaps the god who laughs will find his apotheosis in laughter, and the world will be saved by comedy rather than tragedy.

I do not know. I am not the protagonist of this story; I have made my peace with that. I am a scholar of suns, a survivor of floods, a torturer learning to heal, a man from a dying world serving a god in a world that might yet live.

It is enough.

It has to be enough.

And when the laughter rises and the drums beat and the Sun God dances against the darkness that has ruled for eight hundred years—

I will be there. Watching. Fighting. Adding my small weight to the side of joy.

---

*Postscript:*

I tried again tonight to write Thecla's name.

The sea still resists. My hand still wavers over the letters, still wants to slide into circumlocution.

But I managed it. Thecla. There—I have written it, and the ink holds, and she remains with me, carried forward into whatever dawn awaits.

If the Sun God can bring light without drowning the world—

Perhaps I can carry the dead without being carried under by them.

Perhaps we are all learning, in our different ways, to hold joy and sorrow at once.

The drums are distant tonight. But I can feel them, beneath the rhythm of the sea, beneath the creak of the ship, beneath the laughter drifting down from the deck where Luffy is telling some story that has Usopp in hysterics.

The sun rises. The sun laughs.

And I, Severian the Lame, am sailing toward it.
