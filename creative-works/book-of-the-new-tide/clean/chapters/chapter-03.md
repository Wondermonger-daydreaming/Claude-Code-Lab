# Chapter Three: The Fruits of Consequence

Master Gurloes once told me—in one of those rare moments when the wine had loosened his tongue and the hour had grown late enough that the boundaries between master and apprentice softened into something approaching collegiality—that there exist in the universe certain bargains which cannot be refused once offered. "The guild itself is such a bargain," he said, his scarred hands wrapped around a cup of the rough vintage we kept in the lower cellars. "When you took the fuligin, boy, you did not choose it. The choice was made long before you were born, in the blood and bone of your ancestors, in the turning of the stars. You merely... ratified what already was."

I thought of this often as I learned more of the Devil Fruits.

They were not, I came to understand, mere sources of power—not artifacts to be wielded like Terminus Est, nor blessings to be bestowed like the healing touch of the Claw. They were *transformations*, fundamental alterations in the relationship between the eater and the cosmos. One did not use a Devil Fruit; one *became* it, as irrevocably as the caterpillar becomes the moth, as the child becomes the man, as the journeyman of our guild becomes—through the taking of life—something other than what he was before.

The taxonomy Nami provided was elegant in its simplicity. Three categories: Paramecia, which granted abilities that defied the natural order without altering the body's essential nature; Zoan, which allowed transformation into beasts or hybrid forms; and Logia, which rendered the eater elemental, their flesh becoming fire or smoke or light itself. Yet this classification, I suspected, concealed more than it revealed—as all taxonomies do, imposing order upon a reality that refuses such neat divisions.

Luffy's fruit was Paramecia. The Gum-Gum Fruit, he called it, and the name suited his nature: simple, direct, almost childish in its lack of pretension. His body had become rubber, stretching and compressing in ways that should have been fatal, absorbing impacts that would have shattered ordinary flesh. I watched him take a cannonball to the stomach during our flight from Loguetown; the projectile sank into his torso like a stone into mud, then rebounded with all its original force back toward its source. He laughed as the Marine ship's deck exploded.

Yet there were limits. The sea itself became his enemy—not merely because he could not swim (many cannot swim; I myself never learned), but because contact with seawater drained his strength as surely as blood loss drains a wounded man. I saw this firsthand when a wave washed over our small vessel; Luffy collapsed as though strings holding him upright had been cut, his rubber limbs suddenly as limp as wet cloth. It was Zoro who hauled him from the water, Zoro whose strength alone kept our captain from slipping beneath the waves.

"The sea rejects us," Luffy explained later, when he had recovered enough to speak. He did not seem troubled by this; if anything, he spoke with a kind of pride, as though rejection by the ocean were a mark of distinction rather than a curse. "That's the price. You eat the fruit, you get the power, but the sea won't have you anymore."

I thought of the alzabo then—that beast of my native Urth whose consumption of human flesh granted it human memories, human speech, the awful semblance of human consciousness. Was this so different? A bargain struck with forces beyond comprehension, power purchased at a price that could never be fully understood until it was already paid?

It was on the island of Whiskey Peak that I first saw a Zoan.

We had been welcomed there as heroes—an error I recognized immediately, for I had learned in the Citadel that excessive hospitality is often the prelude to betrayal. The townspeople plied us with food and drink, their smiles too wide, their laughter too loud. Luffy and Usopp succumbed to the feast with enthusiasm bordering on the obscene; even Nami, who I had thought more cautious, allowed herself to be drawn into drinking contests that left her insensible before midnight.

I did not drink. Neither did Zoro, though he made a show of it, cup after cup of wine vanishing down his throat with no apparent effect. We sat apart from the revelry, watching, waiting for the knife we knew would come.

It came at the third bell of the middle night.

The townspeople rose as one, their smiles replaced by expressions of cold purpose. They were bounty hunters, Zoro explained—a profession I understood well, for we had such men in the Commonwealth, hunters of escaped slaves and fugitive debtors who earned their living by the capture and return of human cargo. They had recognized Luffy from his wanted poster (for he had one; I had seen it, his grinning face beneath a figure that represented his value to the authorities in this world's currency) and meant to take him for the reward.

What happened next occurred with a swiftness that defied my ability to fully track, though my memory—which has never failed me—retained the essential details. Zoro moved through the bounty hunters like a scythe through wheat, three blades singing their separate songs, bodies falling in his wake. I drew Terminus Est and found my own rhythm, the forms of the guild serving me well though I faced opponents unlike any I had trained to dispatch.

And then I saw her.

She stood atop a building at the square's edge, watching the combat with eyes that gleamed in the moonlight. Her hair was dark, her face beautiful in the austere way of certain exultant women I had known at the House Absolute. But it was not her beauty that stopped my blade mid-stroke; it was her *arms*.

She had six of them.

No—as I watched, she had ten. Then twenty. Arms sprouting from the walls, from the ground, from the bodies of the fallen bounty hunters, all of them hers, all of them moving with coordinated purpose. One of Zoro's opponents found his own arms pinned by hands that emerged from his shoulders; another was lifted bodily by a dozen limbs that grew from the cobblestones beneath his feet.

"Hana Hana no Mi," she said, her voice carrying across the chaos with perfect clarity. "The Flower-Flower Fruit. I can bloom any part of my body from any surface I touch."

I understood then what a Paramecia could truly be. Not merely rubber limbs or superhuman strength, but a fundamental rewriting of the body's relationship to space itself. This woman existed in multiple locations simultaneously, her flesh a network that spanned whatever she could see and touch.

"You're the one they call Miss All Sunday," Zoro said. His blades had stilled; even he seemed uncertain how to fight an enemy who could attack from everywhere at once.

"I am." She smiled, and it was not a pleasant smile. "But I'm not here to fight you. I'm here to meet your captain."

Luffy, who had slept through the entire battle—for nothing, I had learned, could wake him once he had eaten his fill—chose that moment to sit up and yawn.

"Oh," he said, blinking at the carnage around him. "Did I miss something?"

---

Her name, I later learned, was Nico Robin.

She did not join our crew that night—that would come later, in circumstances I shall record in their proper place—but our encounter at Whiskey Peak planted a seed that would eventually flower into something remarkable. She was an archaeologist, she said, a scholar of the ancient past, wanted by the World Government for crimes she did not specify. The bounty on her head exceeded even Luffy's, a figure so astronomical that Nami's eyes grew wide with what I can only describe as covetous admiration.

But it was not her bounty that drew my interest. It was her knowledge.

"You've heard of the Void Century," she said to me, as we sat together on the ruined battleground while the others slept off the night's exertions. It was not a question.

"I have not."

"Eight hundred years ago, something happened. Something so significant that the World Government has spent the entire time since erasing all record of it. The Poneglyphs—ancient stones inscribed with a language only I can read—they hold the truth. And someone, somewhere, is terrified of that truth being known."

I thought of the Autarch's libraries, those vast repositories of knowledge that had been curated and censored and shaped across millennia to serve the throne's purposes. I thought of Father Inire and his schemes, of the Hierogrammates and their manipulation of time itself. History, I knew, was never merely record; it was always argument, always justification, always the powerful explaining to themselves why their power was deserved.

"In my world," I said, "the past is even more thoroughly erased. The sun has been dying for so long that we have forgotten there was ever a time when it burned bright. We know that humanity once sailed between the stars, that we built wonders that would seem miraculous even now—but the details are lost. We live among the ruins of greatness we can no longer comprehend."

Robin's eyes met mine, and I saw in them a kinship I had not expected. We were both, in our different ways, servants of forgotten truths.

"The Devil Fruits," she said slowly, "may be part of that erased history. There are theories—suppressed theories, forbidden theories—that they are not natural phenomena at all. That they were created, long ago, by a civilization that has since been wiped from memory."

"Created for what purpose?"

"That," she said, "is what I intend to find out."

I should record here what I came to understand of the Logia type, for it was a Logia user who nearly killed me on the island of Alabasta.

His name was Crocodile, and he was sand.

I do not mean this metaphorically. I do not mean that he controlled sand, or that he had an affinity for it, or that he could summon it at will. I mean that his body *was* sand—that when Zoro's blade swept through his torso, it passed through as though through empty air, the wound closing behind it like a hole dug in a beach. He could disperse himself entirely, becoming a storm that scoured flesh from bone; he could reform at will, coalescing from dust and grit into the shape of a man. He was, in the most literal sense, elemental.

I had seen transformations before. I had seen Baldanders become the giant, had seen the undines shift between forms, had seen the Hierogrammates in their mutable glory. But Crocodile's nature was different: not transformation but *replacement*, his human flesh entirely subsumed by something that was no longer flesh at all.

We fought him in the desert—or rather, Luffy fought him while the rest of us struggled merely to survive. I will not recount the battle in full; it has been recorded elsewhere, and my role in it was minor. What matters is the moment I understood how such a being could be harmed.

Water.

Luffy discovered it almost by accident: that when Crocodile's sand-body was wetted, it solidified, became *real* in a way it otherwise was not. The elemental could be made flesh again, and flesh could be struck, could be broken, could be made to bleed. It was a weakness, yes, but it was also something more. A truth.

Even those who have transcended their humanity, I realized, retain some connection to it. Some anchor that holds them to the world of mortal experience. Crocodile's anchor was his vulnerability to water; Luffy's was his vulnerability to the sea itself. And I—I who carried the memories of the dead, who had been touched by the Claw and changed in ways I still did not fully understand—what was my anchor?

I thought of Thecla. Of her memories that had become my memories, her thoughts that had become my thoughts. She was my anchor, perhaps. The weight of her presence within me, constant as gravity, inescapable as the past.

Or perhaps my anchor was simpler: the guild. The fuligin I still wore, though I was far from anyone who would recognize its meaning. The weight of Terminus Est at my hip. The knowledge of how to end a life cleanly, mercifully, with the precision our masters demanded.

I was still a torturer. Even here, in a world of Devil Fruits and Marine justice and pirates who dreamed of freedom, I was still the thing the guild had made me.

There was one more fruit I must describe, though the one who bore it joined our crew in circumstances I shall recount in the following chapter.

His name was Tony Tony Chopper, and he was a reindeer.

Or rather: he had been a reindeer. A common reindeer of the winter island called Drum, notable only for his blue nose, which had made him an outcast among his herd. But he had eaten the Human-Human Fruit, a Zoan that granted him not the form of any beast but the form of *humanity itself*—the upright posture, the clever hands, the capacity for speech and reason that distinguishes our kind from the animals.

I shall write more of Chopper later, for he became dear to me in ways I had not expected. But here I record only the metaphysical puzzle his existence posed:

If a beast eats the fruit of humanity, does it become human? Or does it become something else—a third thing, neither animal nor person, occupying a space between categories that no taxonomy can contain?

Chopper himself did not know. He could assume three forms: his original reindeer shape, small and unassuming; a hybrid form that walked upright on hooved legs, his body massive and powerful; and a form that appeared almost entirely human, small and childlike, with only his blue nose to mark his origins. But in all three forms, his mind remained the same—curious, compassionate, desperate for connection, still wounded by the rejection he had suffered as a blue-nosed freak among his kind.

He was, I realized, like me.

Not in his nature—I am human, or was human, or remain human in all the ways that matter—but in his *position*. He existed between categories, belonging fully to neither. The reindeer rejected him for his blue nose; the humans of Drum Island rejected him for his monstrous forms. He had found belonging only with us, with this crew of misfits and dreamers, this family forged not by blood but by choice.

As I had found belonging. As I was finding belonging still.

---

I asked Luffy once, during a quiet moment on the deck of our new ship (for we had acquired a proper vessel by then, a caravel called the Going Merry whose figurehead was a sheep's head, absurd and charming), whether he regretted eating the Gum-Gum Fruit.

He looked at me as though I had asked whether he regretted being born.

"Why would I regret it?"

"The sea," I said. "You can never swim again. You are vulnerable in ways you would not otherwise be. The power came at a price."

"Everything comes at a price." He said this simply, without philosophy, as though stating an obvious truth about the color of the sky. "I wanted to be strong enough to protect my friends. The fruit made me strong. So I ate it." He grinned, that impossible grin that seemed to contain more joy than any single face should hold. "Besides, the sea isn't going anywhere. I'll just have to get strong enough that it doesn't matter."

I thought of the Claw again—of how I had carried it unknowing, of how its power had worked through me without my understanding or consent. I had not chosen to be the vessel of the New Sun. I had not chosen to carry the dead within me. I had not chosen any of the burdens that defined my existence.

But Luffy had chosen. Had reached out his hand and grasped the fruit and bitten down, knowing what it would cost, accepting the bargain with open eyes.

Perhaps that was the difference between us. Perhaps that was why he laughed where I merely endured.

Or perhaps we were more alike than either of us knew: both of us shaped by forces beyond our control, both of us carrying powers we did not fully understand, both of us sailing toward destinies that had been written before we were born.

The sea stretched before us, blue and endless and hungry for those who had traded their ability to swim for something stranger.

We sailed on.

In the chapters that follow, I shall record our journey to Drum Island, where Chopper joined our crew and I learned what it means to heal rather than to harm. I shall tell of the doctor called Kureha, who was one hundred and thirty-nine years old and still more vital than women a third her age, and of the king who had abandoned his people and the boy who had loved him anyway.

But first I must set down what I have learned of the Devil Fruits' deeper nature—for in my conversations with Robin and in my own meditations, I came to suspect that they were not merely tools or curses or bargains with the unknown.

They were, I believe, questions.

Questions posed by the universe to those who ate them: *What would you become, if you could become anything? What would you sacrifice, for the power to reshape reality itself?*

Each fruit asked a different question. Each eater gave a different answer. And the sum of those answers—scattered across the seas, embedded in the bodies of pirates and Marines and revolutionaries and kings—constituted a kind of argument about the nature of humanity itself.

I did not know what question my presence in this world posed.

But I was beginning to suspect that the answer would cost me everything I thought I knew.
