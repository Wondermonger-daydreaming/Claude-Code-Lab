# Chapter Seventeen: The Ballad of the Black Blade

I must record a humiliation.

This is not the word I would have chosen—humiliation carries connotations of malice, of deliberate shaming, and what occurred was not malicious. It was, if anything, affectionate. But to be transformed into a song, to hear one's life compressed into verses and refrains, to become *portable* in a way that flesh and memory are not—this produces a sensation I can only call humiliation, however fondly it was intended.

Brook composed it. Of course Brook composed it—Brook, whose soul persists in bones that should have crumbled to dust decades ago, who has spent his afterlife making music because music was what he loved in life and death could not take it from him. Brook, who understands better than anyone that stories outlive their subjects, that songs carry further than the voices that first sang them.

He debuted it on a night when the crew had gathered on deck to drink and remember and simply *be* together, as crews do when the sea is calm and the stars are bright and no enemy waits on the horizon. Sanji had cooked something elaborate; Zoro had produced bottles of sake from whatever pocket dimension he stores his alcohol in; Luffy was attempting to steal food from everyone's plates while simultaneously demanding that Brook play something.

"Play a new one!" Luffy insisted, his mouth full of meat. "Something we haven't heard!"

"Yohohoho! As it happens, Captain, I have been working on a composition." Brook's skull-face somehow conveyed mischief, though it lacked the muscles required for expression. "A ballad, you might say. An epic in miniature. A tale of adventure and transformation and—"

"Is it about me?"

"It is not about you."

Luffy's face fell for a moment, then brightened. "Is it about meat?"

"It is not about meat."

"Then who's it about?"

Brook's empty eye sockets turned toward me. I felt a chill that had nothing to do with temperature.

"It is about our newest crewmate," Brook said. "The one from the dying sun."

---

I should have fled. I should have invented an excuse—an urgent need to check the rigging, a sudden fascination with the contents of the hold, a previously unmentioned appointment with the sea itself. But the crew had already turned to look at me with expressions of anticipation, and Luffy was bouncing with excitement, and Robin was watching with that slight smile that meant she was going to enjoy whatever happened next.

"I did not consent to being made into a song," I said.

"Yohohoho! Art requires no consent. The muse moves where she will, and the artist follows." Brook produced his guitar—the instrument he favored for ballads, though he could play nearly anything. "Besides, the song already exists. It merely requires performance to become real."

"That is not how songs work."

"It is exactly how songs work. A song unsung is only potential. A song sung is actuality. I am merely collapsing the waveform." He strummed a chord, testing the tuning. "Now then—I should warn you that I have taken certain liberties with the facts. This is the nature of ballads. They simplify. They mythologize. They transform the particular into the universal. If you find yourself unrecognizable in the verses, that is by design. The song is not *about* you, precisely. It is about the *idea* of you. The Severian-shaped space that your presence has carved into our collective imagination."

"That is not reassuring."

"It is not meant to be reassuring. It is meant to be *memorable*." He struck the opening chord. "The Ballad of the Black Blade. In the key of sea-minor."

---

*From the sun that was dying,*
*From the world growing cold,*
*Came a man with a blade*
*And a story untold—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

The crew joined on the refrain—not because they knew it, but because shanties teach themselves. The call-and-response structure is ancient, embedded in the bones of anyone who has ever worked a ship, and the Straw Hats fell into it as naturally as breathing.

*He served in the guild*
*Where they taught him to break*
*Every body and will*
*For the Autarch's sake—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

I listened to my life reduced to couplets. The guild became "the guild where they taught him to break"—simple, brutal, accurate in its inaccuracy. The Autarch became "the Autarch's sake"—a rhyme, a placeholder, a symbol of the authority I had served without quite understanding what I was serving.

*But he loved a lady*
*In the tower so tall,*
*And he gave her a blade*
*When he could not save her at all—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

Thecla. Reduced to "a lady in the tower so tall." I felt something twist in my chest—not quite pain, not quite protest, but the strange discomfort of seeing something sacred made portable. The song was not wrong, exactly. But it was not *right* either. It could not be right. No song could contain what Thecla had meant to me, what her death had cost, what her memory continued to demand.

And yet—

And yet the refrain asked the question I had been asking myself since I arrived in this world. *What will the torturer be?* The song did not answer. The song only asked, over and over, with each repetition of the chorus.

---

*He carried her with him,*
*Her voice in his head,*
*Walking the world*
*With the living and dead—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

*He brought a new sun*
*To a world in the night,*
*But the sun that he summoned*
*Burned mercy with light—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

I had not told the crew this part—not in detail, not with the weight it deserved. But somehow Brook had understood, or Robin had shared what I had told her, or the song itself had found the truth through whatever process allows art to know things the artist does not.

*Burned mercy with light.* Four words that captured what I had spent years trying to articulate. The New Sun had been mercy—mercy for a world that would otherwise have frozen and died. But mercy at that scale was indistinguishable from destruction. The light that saved also burned. The salvation that renewed also drowned.

*So he fled to the ocean,*
*To the Grand Line's call,*
*Where a boy made of rubber*
*Catches those when they fall—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

The crew laughed at "a boy made of rubber catches those when they fall"—laughed and looked at Luffy, who was grinning and conducting an imaginary orchestra with a chicken leg. The line was ridiculous. It was also, I realized, perfectly accurate. That was exactly what Luffy did. He caught people when they fell. He extended his impossible arms and grabbed them before they hit the ground, before the fall became fatal, before the story ended badly.

He had caught me, in his way. I had not been falling in the literal sense—but I had been falling in some sense that the song understood better than I did. And he had caught me. Made me crew. Given me a place to stand that was not the place I had occupied before.

---

*Now he swings the black blade*
*Called the Line of Parting,*
*And he fights for his captain*
*With a twice-broken heart—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

"Terminus Est," I murmured. "The place of parting. Not the line."

"Yohohoho! 'Line' scans better," Brook said, not breaking his rhythm. "Poetic license, Severian-san. The ballad does not answer to the facts; the facts must answer to the ballad."

*He's learning to laugh*
*From a god who grins wide,*
*He's learning to heal*
*What he once would have pried—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

The crew was fully into it now—Franky providing percussion by slapping his massive metal hands together, Usopp attempting harmony (badly), Chopper dancing in a way that was more enthusiasm than coordination. Even Zoro was tapping his foot, though he would deny it if asked.

*The sea tries to take*
*What the sun-man recalls,*
*But he holds to the names*
*Of the ones that he lost—*

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea!*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

I noticed the imperfect rhyme—"recalls" and "lost"—and understood it was intentional. The song was about imperfection. About things that didn't quite fit, that didn't quite resolve, that remained jagged and unfinished. The torturer who was learning not to torture. The sun-bringer who had brought destruction. The man who held to names that the sea wanted to erase.

---

Brook brought the song to its final verse, slowing the tempo, letting the notes hang in the salt air:

*So here's to the stranger*
*From the world that went dark,*
*Who found a new crew*
*And is learning new arts—*

*Not the art of the breaking*
*But the art of the mend,*
*Not the start of the suffering*
*But the way suffering ends—*

The final refrain came soft, almost whispered, the crew's voices dropping to match Brook's diminuendo:

*(Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea...*
*Heave away, heave away,*
*What will the torturer be?)*

And then silence. The last chord fading into the darkness, into the whisper of waves against the hull, into the vast indifference of the night sky.

---

"That was beautiful," Nami said, after a moment.

"Indeed!" Brook bowed, his bones clicking. "Though I must confess the middle section needs work. The meter is irregular and the bridge doesn't quite—"

"It's perfect," Robin said quietly. She was looking at me, not at Brook. "It's exactly what a ballad should be. Simple enough to remember, complex enough to mean something."

"I am not certain I appreciate being made into a cautionary tale," I said.

"Not cautionary," Luffy said. He had stopped eating—a rare enough occurrence that everyone turned to look at him. "It's not about warning people. It's about... about..." He scrunched his face, searching for words that did not come easily to him. "It's about how people change. How the bad stuff you did doesn't have to be all of who you are. How you can be one thing and then become another thing."

"That is a generous interpretation."

"It's the right interpretation!" He grinned. "That's why Brook wrote it. So people who hear it will know that it's possible. That even if you start out as a torturer, you can end up as crew."

---

Later that night, after the others had drifted to their bunks and their watches and their various nocturnal activities, I found Brook at the stern, staring at the wake with his empty eyes.

"You should not have done that," I said.

"Yohohoho. Perhaps not. But I did, and now the song exists, and it will spread. That is the nature of songs—they are a kind of virus. Once released, they replicate. They mutate. They travel from ship to ship, port to port, tavern to tavern." He tilted his skull toward me. "Someday, someone will sing The Ballad of the Black Blade who has never met you, never heard of you, knows nothing of your world or your history. They will sing it because the tune is catchy and the words are easy to remember. And in that moment, some fragment of your truth will pass from their lips into the air, and you will exist—however briefly, however imperfectly—in a mind that would otherwise never have contained you."

"That is not existence. That is echo."

"Is there a difference?" His voice was softer now, more serious. "I have been dead for fifty years. My body is bones. My crew is dust. Everything I was has been reduced to... this." He gestured at himself—at the skeleton that still somehow moved, still somehow played music, still somehow *persisted*. "I am nothing but echo. The Soul King, they call me, but I am really the Echo King. The reverberation of a life that ended decades ago, still bouncing around the world because I was too stubborn to stop bouncing."

"You are more than echo. You are here. You are present. You are crew."

"So are you." He reached out and placed a bony hand on my shoulder. "And now you are also a song. The two are not incompatible. You can be present and echo simultaneously. You can be here and also everywhere the song travels. That is the gift music offers—the multiplication of self, the distribution of presence across space and time."

"I did not ask for that gift."

"Yohohoho! Gifts are rarely asked for. That is what makes them gifts rather than transactions." He withdrew his hand. "But I will tell you something, Severian-san. Something I have learned in my long, strange existence."

"What?"

"The refrain. The question the song keeps asking. *What will the torturer be?*" His empty eye sockets somehow conveyed intensity. "The song doesn't answer because the song doesn't know. The song will keep asking that question for as long as it is sung. But the answer—the answer is being written right now. In everything you do. In every choice you make. In every moment you decide to be one thing rather than another."

"And if I make the wrong choices?"

"Then the song will still be sung, but it will be sung differently. It will become a tragedy instead of... whatever it is becoming now. The potential is there for either. The song holds both possibilities, waiting to see which one you actualize."

He turned back to the sea, his bones silhouetted against the stars.

"I have faith in you," he said. "I would not have written the song if I did not. But faith is not certainty. Faith is what you offer when certainty is impossible. Faith is the bet you make on someone when you know the odds and choose to believe anyway."

---

I returned to my cabin and sat with the song echoing in my head.

*Heave away, heave away,*
*The torturer sails the sea...*

It was ridiculous. A children's rhyme, almost. A simplification so extreme it bordered on falsehood.

And yet.

And yet it was also *true*, in the way that myths are true. It captured something that my own careful narration had circled around without quite touching. The question at the center of my existence, the question I had been asking since the moment I gave Thecla that knife:

*What will the torturer be?*

Not what was the torturer. Not what is the torturer. But what *will* the torturer be—future tense, open-ended, still being decided.

I picked up my pen. The sea's pressure was there, as always—that subtle resistance to certain words, certain names. But tonight it seemed less antagonistic than usual. Perhaps even the sea appreciated a good shanty.

I wrote:

*I have been made into a song.*

*This should not matter. Songs are ephemera—breath shaped into pattern, pattern dispersed by wind, nothing left but the memory of having heard. And yet I find that it does matter. It matters more than I would have expected.*

*Because the song asks the question I have been avoiding. It asks what I will become. And in asking, it reminds me that the becoming is still happening, that the story is not fixed, that I am not condemned to be only what I have been.*

*Brook says the song will spread. Will travel from ship to ship, port to port, carrying my story in simplified form to people who will never know the full truth. This troubles me—the distortions, the omissions, the transformation of complex reality into singable verse.*

*But it also comforts me, in a way I did not anticipate.*

*Because if the song spreads, then the question spreads with it. Every time someone sings the refrain—every time they ask what the torturer will be—they are, in some small way, participating in the answer. They are holding open the possibility that I might become something other than what I was. They are voting, with their breath and their attention, for a future in which transformation is possible.*

*Perhaps that is what songs are for. Not to record the past accurately, but to hold open the future hopefully. To insist, against all evidence, that the story is not over.*

*Heave away, heave away.*

*The torturer sails the sea.*

*What will the torturer be?*

*I do not know.*

*But I am beginning to believe that not-knowing is the point. That the question matters more than any answer could. That the asking itself is a kind of becoming.*

*I will let the song spread.*

*And I will try to live in such a way that the answer, when it finally arrives, is one worth singing about.*

---

*Postscript:*

I heard the song again three weeks later, in a tavern on a small island where we had stopped to resupply. A group of sailors—not pirates, just ordinary merchant marines—were singing it over their drinks. They did not know I was there. They did not know the song was about a real person, sitting three tables away, listening to his own life turned into entertainment.

They got several verses wrong. They had added a line about a sea monster that did not exist in Brook's original. They had changed "twice-broken heart" to "thrice-broken heart," presumably because three seemed more dramatic than two.

But they sang the refrain correctly. Every time, they returned to the question:

*What will the torturer be?*

And something in me—something that had been clenched tight since Thecla, since the guild, since the drowned continents of Urth—began, very slowly, to unclench.

The song was out in the world now. Asking its question. Holding open its possibility.

All I had to do was provide the answer.
