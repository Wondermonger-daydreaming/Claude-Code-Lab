# Chapter Sixteen: Dereshishishi

The library was built into the roots of the great tree.

I had not expected to find a library in Elbaf. The giants, by reputation, were warriors—their culture one of combat and honor, of battles that lasted decades and grudges that lasted longer. But Robin had spoken of this place with a reverence I had rarely heard in her voice, and when she asked if I would accompany her to meet someone, I understood that the asking itself was significant. Robin did not ask for company. Robin endured company, accepted it, sometimes even welcomed it—but she did not *ask*.

So I went.

The descent was gentler than my journey to Loki's prison—a winding path through root-chambers that had been shaped, over years or centuries, into spaces that accommodated both giant and human scale. Shelves lined the walls, carved directly into the wood, and on those shelves rested books. Thousands of books. Tens of thousands. More books than I had seen in any single place since the Citadel's own library, that vast repository of the Commonwealth's accumulated knowledge.

"These are the books of Ohara," Robin said quietly. "Or what could be saved of them."

"I thought Ohara was destroyed."

"It was. The island. The scholars. The Tree of Knowledge that held our library." Her voice was steady, but I had learned to hear the fractures beneath her composure. "But someone saved what he could. Someone carried the books out of the flames and brought them here, to Elbaf, where the World Government could not follow."

"Someone."

"Someone I thought was dead for twenty years."

---

He was waiting for us in the deepest chamber—a vast space where the roots formed a natural dome, where light filtered through gaps in the wood in patterns that shifted with the movement of the tree above. He sat cross-legged on the floor, a book open in his lap, and even seated he was enormous: three times my height at least, his body thick with muscle that had not diminished despite decades of scholarly work.

His face was kind. That was the first thing I noticed. Giants, in my limited experience, tended toward fierceness even in repose—their features shaped by lives of combat, by the expectation of violence. But this giant's face was gentle, weathered by time and sorrow into an expression of profound patience.

And his eyes, when they found Robin, filled with tears.

"Robin," he said. Just her name. Just the two syllables, carrying twenty years of grief and hope and disbelief.

She ran to him. I had never seen Robin run—she moved always with deliberate grace, with the controlled precision of someone who had learned that haste attracted attention. But she ran to this giant and he caught her in hands that could have crushed her without effort, and he held her against his chest, and they wept together in a language older than words.

I stood at the entrance and did not intrude.

---

When the reunion had gentled into something that could accommodate a third presence, the giant looked at me.

His gaze was assessing but not hostile—the gaze of a scholar examining a new text, trying to determine its provenance and significance. I had been evaluated by experts before; I recognized the quality of attention.

"You're the one from the dying sun," he said. His voice was deep, resonant, carrying the particular weight of someone accustomed to speaking across great distances. "Robin has told me about you."

"She has told me about you as well, Jaguar D. Saul." I inclined my head—the gesture of respect one scholar offers another. "I understand I owe you a debt I cannot repay."

"A debt?"

"You saved her life. Without that act, she would not have survived to become my crewmate. The good she has done me, the knowledge she has shared, the companionship she has offered—all of it traces back to a moment when you chose to defy your orders and preserve something precious."

Saul's laugh surprised me. It was not the laugh I expected from a giant—not booming or thunderous but *delighted*, almost childlike, rolling through several syllables in a pattern I had not heard before.

"Dereshishishi! You talk like the scholars did. Formal. Precise. Like every word is being weighed on a scale." He set Robin down gently—she had composed herself now, though her eyes were still red—and leaned forward to examine me more closely. "But there's something else in there too. Something heavier than scholarship."

"I was not only a scholar."

"No." His eyes narrowed slightly. "You were something that learned to kill. I can see it in how you stand, how you watch the exits, how your hand stays close to that sword even when there's no threat. I was a Marine for thirty years. I know what training looks like."

"I was a torturer. A member of the Guild of Seekers for Truth and Penitence, in a world very different from this one."

I expected disgust. I expected the recoil that most people showed when I named my former profession. But Saul only nodded slowly, as though I had confirmed a suspicion rather than revealed a horror.

"And now?"

"Now I am trying to be something else."

"Dereshishishi." The laugh again, but softer. "That's the hardest thing there is. Being something else. I was a Vice Admiral, you know. Sworn to uphold justice in the name of the World Government. I believed in what I was doing. Believed I was protecting people from pirates and criminals and all the dangers of the sea."

"What changed?"

He looked at Robin. She had moved to one of the bookshelves and was running her fingers along the spines, reacquainting herself with volumes she had thought lost forever. His expression as he watched her was the expression of a man contemplating a miracle.

"I met a child who had committed no crime except wanting to know the truth. And I watched my comrades prepare to murder her for it."

---

We talked for hours.

Or rather—Saul talked, and I listened, and occasionally I offered fragments of my own experience when they seemed relevant. It was the kind of conversation I had not had since leaving the Citadel: two people with incompatible backgrounds discovering, through careful exchange, that their incompatibilities were superficial and their depths rhymed.

He told me about Ohara.

Not the Ohara of official history—the Ohara that had been erased, declared to have never existed, its scholars condemned as criminals and its knowledge branded as heresy. He told me about the Ohara he had found when his ship landed there on a routine patrol: an island of researchers, archaeologists, historians. People who wanted to read the past, not weaponize it.

"They were the kindest people I ever met," he said. "Completely absorbed in their work. Arguing about translations, about interpretations, about whether a particular glyph meant 'king' or 'ruler' or something else entirely. They didn't care about power or politics. They just wanted to *know*."

"And the Government decided they knew too much."

"The Government decided that what they knew was dangerous. Not because it was wrong, but because it was *true*." His voice darkened. "The Void Century. The Great Kingdom. The Ancient Weapons. All of it was real, and all of it pointed to questions that the World Nobles couldn't allow anyone to ask."

"What questions?"

Saul glanced at Robin. She had stopped browsing the shelves and was listening now, her expression unreadable.

"Robin knows better than I do. She's spent her whole life searching for the answers. But the core of it is simple: eight hundred years ago, something happened that the people who rule this world are desperate to hide. Something so significant that they've maintained an entire apparatus of censorship and murder for eight centuries just to keep it buried."

"The truth about what the World Government is," Robin said quietly. "What it did to become what it is. What it has to keep doing to remain what it is."

"And Ohara got too close to that truth."

"Ohara was days away from reading the Rio Poneglyph—the complete message hidden across all the Road Poneglyphs. The scholars had assembled most of the pieces. They knew that if they could find the final fragments, they could reconstruct the history of the Void Century in its entirety." Robin's voice was steady, but I could hear the effort it cost her. "The Government couldn't allow that. So they sent the Buster Call."

---

I knew, from Robin's earlier account, what the Buster Call meant. Ten battleships. Five Vice Admirals. The authority to destroy anything and anyone in pursuit of the designated target. It was the World Government's ultimate sanction—not justice but *erasure*, the power to unmake whatever threatened the established order.

"I was there," Saul said. "I was supposed to be part of it. Vice Admiral Jaguar D. Saul, following orders, doing his duty. But when I saw what we were actually doing—when I saw the scholars being executed for the crime of reading, when I saw the evacuation ships being sunk to ensure no survivors, when I saw a child standing in the flames with nowhere to run—"

He stopped. His massive hands closed into fists, then slowly opened again.

"I couldn't. I just couldn't. Whatever I had believed about justice, about the Marines, about my duty—none of it could justify what I was watching. So I grabbed Robin and I ran."

"And died for it."

"I should have died. Kuzan—Admiral Aokiji now, though he was a Vice Admiral then—he froze me solid. It should have been fatal. But..." He laughed again, but this time the laugh was wondering, almost confused. "I woke up. Days later, maybe weeks—I don't know exactly. I was still frozen, but I was alive inside the ice. And the giants of Elbaf found me."

"They thawed you?"

"Eventually. It took years. And by the time I was fully recovered, Ohara was ash and Robin was gone and the world thought both of us were dead." He shook his head. "I couldn't go back to the Marines. I couldn't go searching for Robin—that would only draw attention to her, make it easier for the Government to find her. All I could do was protect what I had managed to save: the books I had grabbed during the chaos, the fragments of Ohara's knowledge that I had carried out of the flames."

"You became a librarian."

"I became a *keeper*. Of knowledge that has no home. Of truth that the world has tried to murder." He looked at me with those gentle, assessing eyes. "You understand what that means, don't you?"

---

I did understand.

I thought of the brown books in the Citadel's library—texts so old that their knowledge had become legend, their facts indistinguishable from myth. I thought of Master Ultan, the librarian who had guided me through those stacks, who had spent his life preserving knowledge that most of the Commonwealth had forgotten existed. I thought of the way the guild itself was a kind of preservation: techniques passed from master to journeyman to apprentice, maintained across generations, kept alive through practice even when the reasons for the practice had been lost.

"In my world," I said slowly, "we had a saying: 'The brown book remembers what the reader forgets.' It meant that knowledge persists in text even when the people who created it have died, even when the civilization that produced it has crumbled. The book doesn't care whether anyone reads it. It simply *is*, waiting for the reader who will come."

"Dereshishishi! Yes. Exactly." Saul leaned forward, his eyes bright. "The books don't know they're forbidden. They don't know the Government has declared them dangerous. They just sit on their shelves, holding their contents, ready to share with anyone who opens them. The censors can burn the copies, but they can't burn the *knowledge*—not completely. As long as one copy survives, as long as one reader remains who can understand, the truth persists."

"And you have kept it persisting. For twenty years, in this library, you have kept Ohara alive."

"Not alive. Ohara is dead. The scholars are dead. The Tree of Knowledge is ash." He said this without bitterness, simply stating facts. "But what they knew—what they discovered, what they devoted their lives to understanding—that still exists. In these books. In Robin's mind. In the work that continues even though the workers are gone."

---

Robin had joined us now, sitting at her old friend's feet like a child at story time. But her expression was adult, weighted with the twenty years she had spent carrying Ohara's burden alone.

"Saul," she said, "I need to tell you what I've learned. Since we parted. Since I thought you died."

"Tell me."

And she did.

She told him about the Poneglyphs she had found—the fragments scattered across the Grand Line, each one holding a piece of the message Ohara had nearly assembled. She told him about the Road Poneglyphs specifically, the four red stones that together revealed the location of Laugh Tale. She told him about the revelations of Egghead, about Vegapunk's broadcast, about the rising seas and the hidden history and the figure called Imu who sat on the Empty Throne.

She told him about Joy Boy.

Saul listened without interrupting. His face cycled through expressions—wonder, grief, vindication, fear—but he held his questions until she had finished.

"So the scholars were right," he said finally. "About all of it. The Great Kingdom, the Ancient Weapons, the truth the Government has spent eight hundred years suppressing—it's all real. It's all connected."

"Yes."

"And this boy—this Luffy—he's the one the prophecies spoke of? The inheritor of Joy Boy's will?"

"I believe so. I've watched him become what he's becoming. I've seen him awaken powers that haven't existed in this world for centuries." Robin glanced at me. "And Severian has seen it too. He understands what it means, perhaps better than most. His world had its own prophecies, its own figures of salvation."

Saul turned to me. "Tell me about your world's sun."

---

I had not expected the question, but I should have. A scholar of forbidden knowledge would naturally be curious about knowledge from beyond his world entirely.

"Our sun was dying," I said. "Had been dying for longer than anyone could remember. The light grew dimmer with each generation; the seasons grew colder; the ice crept further down from the poles. We lived in the shadow of an ending that everyone knew was coming but no one could prevent."

"And the prophecy?"

"The prophecy said that a New Sun would come. That a Conciliator had walked among us, ages ago, and had set in motion events that would culminate in renewal. That someone would be chosen—or would choose themselves, the distinction was never clear—to bring the white fountain across the gulfs of time and space and restore what had been lost."

"Did it happen?"

I hesitated. This was the part of the story I rarely told—the part that complicated any simple narrative of salvation.

"Yes. The New Sun came. I was the one who brought it—or the one through whom it was brought, the distinction remains unclear to me even now. The light returned. The ice melted. The world began to heal."

"Then why do you look like that when you speak of it?"

"Because the ice melting meant the seas rose. Because the healing meant transformation, and transformation meant death for those who could not transform quickly enough. Because the salvation I brought was also a destruction, and I am not certain, even now, whether the world that emerged was worth the world that drowned."

Saul was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was gentle.

"The Buster Call that destroyed Ohara—the Government called it justice. They said the scholars were criminals, that their knowledge was a weapon, that destroying them was necessary to protect the world from dangerous ideas. They believed they were saving people. Maybe some of them genuinely believed it."

"You're saying I was a Buster Call?"

"I'm saying that destruction in the name of salvation is the oldest story there is. The question is not whether destruction occurred. The question is whether you chose it, whether you understood its costs, and whether you carry those costs honestly."

"I carry them. I am not certain I carry them honestly. Honesty would require a clarity about my own motivations that I do not possess."

"Dereshishishi!" The laugh was warm, almost approving. "That's more honesty than most people manage. The ones who are truly dangerous are the ones who believe they understand themselves perfectly."

---

We sat together in the root-library as the light shifted through its daily cycles, three keepers of forbidden knowledge comparing the shapes of what we carried.

Saul spoke of the Will of D—the mysterious initial that appeared in certain names across history, marking individuals who seemed destined to challenge the established order. Gol D. Roger. Monkey D. Luffy. Portgas D. Ace. Jaguar D. Saul himself.

"I don't fully understand what it means," he admitted. "None of us do, who carry it. But there's a pattern—we tend to die smiling. We tend to laugh in the face of death. We tend to be the rocks that the World Government breaks itself against, even when it seems like they've won."

"Joy Boy was a D?"

"We think so. The name itself—Joy Boy—might be a kind of translation of what the D means. Someone who carries joy even into darkness. Someone whose will persists even after their body fails."

I thought of Luffy, laughing as he fought Kaido. Thought of the drums that had filled the air when he awakened, the heartbeat of a god who found existence amusing.

"In my world," I said, "we had the Claw of the Conciliator—a relic that healed by channeling grace through the one who wielded it. I carried it for a time. And I found that it only worked when I forgot I was holding it, when I acted without thinking about the power I possessed. As soon as I tried to use it deliberately, it became inert."

"Like Haki," Robin said quietly. "The will that manifests when you stop trying to manifest it."

"Like the D," Saul added. "The destiny that only fulfills itself when you stop trying to fulfill it. We don't choose to be what we are. We just... become it. By living. By refusing to stop living, even when the world wants us dead."

---

"There's something I need to ask you," I said to Saul. "Something that has troubled me since I arrived in this world."

"Ask."

"The sea. It has been... editing me. Changing my memories, making certain names difficult to write or speak. I have felt it reaching into my mind and smoothing away things it does not want me to retain." I paused, trying to find the right words. "In my world, the Increate—the divine presence that underlies existence—made itself known through signs and wonders, through the order that persisted beneath the chaos. But here, the only presence I can detect is the sea itself. And the sea seems to want to unmake me."

Saul's expression grew thoughtful. "The sea has always been strange. The old sailors—the ones who've been sailing for fifty years, sixty years—they talk about it like it's alive. Like it remembers. They say the Grand Line in particular has a mind of its own, that it chooses who passes and who doesn't."

"And the Devil Fruit curse? The sea rejects those who have eaten of its power."

"Yes. That's always seemed significant to me. The fruits grant power, but the price is that you can no longer return to the sea—you can no longer be embraced by it, held by it, carried by it. You become something other than what the sea recognizes as its own."

"Do you think the sea is divine? The Increate of this world?"

Saul laughed—but this time the laugh was uncertain, questioning rather than affirming.

"I don't know. I've spent twenty years in a library, surrounded by books that describe powers and histories beyond anything I imagined when I was a Marine. I've read accounts of the Void Century that suggest the world was different then—that the relationship between land and sea, between humans and the ocean, was not what it is now. Something changed. Something fundamental. And the sea we have now might be... a consequence of that change. A scar, maybe. Or a wound that never healed."

"Or a god that was broken," I said, "and reassembled itself into something that no longer remembers what it was meant to be."

Robin looked at me sharply. "You think the sea was a god?"

"I think something in this world functions the way gods function in other worlds—as a ground of being, a source of meaning, a presence that shapes existence even when it cannot be directly perceived. And if that something is the sea, then the sea's antagonism toward me makes a certain sense. I am from outside. I carry memories of a different order. My very existence is a challenge to the coherence of whatever story the sea is trying to tell."

---

Saul was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was soft—almost reverent.

"The scholars of Ohara believed something similar. They thought the Void Century wasn't just a period of missing history—it was a period when history itself was broken. When the story the world tells about itself was disrupted, edited, rewritten. They believed that the Poneglyphs were fragments of the original story, the one that existed before the editing began."

"And the World Government is the editor."

"The World Government, or whatever sits behind it. Imu, if what Robin says is true." He shook his massive head. "But here's what I've never understood: if you have the power to edit history, to reshape the story of the world, why leave the Poneglyphs at all? Why leave any trace of the original? If you're truly rewriting reality, why do it incompletely?"

"Because complete erasure is impossible," I said. "This I know from my own experience. The guild tried to erase certain things—certain techniques that were deemed too dangerous to preserve, certain knowledge that was meant to die with the masters who held it. But something always persisted. A reference in an old text. A technique that was reinvented by accident. A student who remembered more than they were supposed to. The past is not a document that can be burned. The past is a... a pressure. It pushes against the present even when every record of it has been destroyed."

"The Will of D," Robin said suddenly. "That's what it is. The Will of D is the past pushing against the present. It's the original story refusing to stay edited. It's Joy Boy's laughter echoing across eight centuries, finding new voices to laugh through."

Saul smiled—a smile that held both grief and hope in equal measure.

"Dereshishishi. Maybe that's why we die smiling. Because we know the story isn't over. Because we know that even if they kill us, they can't kill what we carry. The will persists. The laughter continues. And sooner or later, someone comes along who can laugh loud enough to crack the editing apart."

---

As we prepared to leave—Robin reluctant, Saul insistent that she should go, that her place was with her crew and her captain and the story that was still being written—Saul took my hand.

His palm was enormous. My entire hand disappeared within his grip. But the touch was gentle, precise, calibrated to avoid harm.

"Severian," he said. "I don't know what you were in your world. I don't know if the things you did were justified or monstrous or some combination that defies easy categorization. But I know what you are now: you're crew to a boy who carries Joy Boy's will. You're companion to a woman who carries Ohara's knowledge. You're part of a story that's been waiting eight hundred years to be told."

"I did not choose this role."

"Dereshishishi! None of us choose. That's what makes it real." He released my hand but held my gaze. "The scholars of Ohara didn't choose to become martyrs. I didn't choose to become a traitor. Robin didn't choose to become the last reader of a murdered language. We just... found ourselves in positions where the choice was made for us. Where saying no would have meant becoming something we couldn't live with."

"And you think that's what I am? Someone who couldn't say no?"

"I think you're someone who said yes when you didn't have to. You could have stayed apart. You could have observed without participating, kept your distance, protected yourself from whatever is coming. Instead, you joined a pirate crew and learned to fight alongside people who will probably die in the war that's approaching." He smiled. "That's not nothing. That's not nothing at all."

---

Robin embraced him one last time before we left—a long embrace, filled with all the words that couldn't be spoken, all the years that couldn't be recovered.

"I'll come back," she said. "When this is over. When we've found the One Piece and learned the truth about everything. I'll come back and we'll read the Rio Poneglyph together."

"I'll be here. The books aren't going anywhere. And neither am I." He looked at her with those gentle eyes, those eyes that had watched her run from flames twenty years ago and had never stopped watching, never stopped hoping. "Live, Robin. That's all I've ever wanted for you. Just live."

"I'm trying."

"I know you are. And now you have people who are trying with you." He glanced at me. "Take care of her, Severian of the Dying Sun. She carries more than anyone should have to carry alone."

"I know," I said. "So do I. So does everyone on our crew. That is, perhaps, what makes us crew—the recognition that the weight is too heavy for any one person, and the choice to share it anyway."

"Dereshishishi!" The laugh echoed through the root-library, bouncing off the shelves of forbidden books, filling the space with something that felt, despite everything, like joy. "That's exactly right. That's exactly right."

---

We climbed back toward the surface, Robin and I, leaving the giant and his library behind. The light grew stronger as we ascended; the air grew warmer; the sounds of Elbaf—the voices of giants, the wind through the tree, the distant crash of waves—gradually replaced the silence of the depths.

At the entrance to the root-chamber, Robin paused.

"Thank you," she said. "For coming with me. For talking with him. For... understanding."

"Thank you for inviting me. For trusting me with something so precious."

She nodded, a small smile crossing her face—rare and therefore valuable, like a book that exists in only one copy.

"He liked you. Saul. I could tell."

"How?"

"The laugh. He only laughs like that—the real laugh, the dereshishi—when he's genuinely happy. When he's found something worth laughing about." She looked at me, and her eyes held something I had not seen in them before: not suspicion, not assessment, but something closer to kinship. "He thinks you're worth laughing about."

"I am not certain that is a compliment."

"It is. Trust me. From Saul, it's the highest compliment there is."

---

That night, I sat on the deck of the Sunny and wrote in my journal. The words came easier than usual—the sea seemed quiet, for once, its editing pressure reduced to a background hum rather than an active interference.

I wrote:

*I met a giant today who carries the dead of a murdered island. He has spent twenty years in a library, preserving books that the world has declared criminal, keeping alive the knowledge that powerful men have tried to erase.*

*He laughed. Despite everything—despite the loss, the exile, the decades of solitary guardianship—he laughed. And his laugh was not bitter, not ironic, not the dark humor of the survivor who has learned to mock their own suffering. It was genuine. It was joyful. It was the laugh of someone who has found, in the very things that should have destroyed him, a reason to persist.*

*I do not know if I can learn to laugh like that. The guild did not teach us laughter; it taught us the opposite, the solemn administration of pain, the grave dignity of the torturer who takes no pleasure in his work. And Thecla—Thecla's laughter, which I carry within me, is tangled with too much grief to ring clearly.*

*But I can recognize it. I can honor it. I can stand beside those who laugh and let their laughter teach me what my training never could.*

*The Will of D, Saul called it. The will that laughs even in death, that persists even through erasure, that pushes against the present until the present cracks.*

*Perhaps that is what the Increate looks like in this world. Not a power above creation, but a power within it—the laughter that refuses to stop, the joy that survives even the darkest editing, the will that echoes across centuries until it finds a voice strong enough to speak it into the world again.*

*Luffy laughs.*

*Robin is learning to smile.*

*And I—I am beginning to understand why they call the final island Laugh Tale.*

*Perhaps when we arrive there, when we finally see what Roger saw and learn what he learned, I will understand the joke. Perhaps I will even be able to laugh.*

*I hope so.*

*I hope so very much.*

---

*Postscript:*

Saul's laugh stayed with me longer than his words. In the nights that followed, when I woke from dreams of Thecla and the guild and the drowned continents of Urth, I would hear it—distant but distinct, rolling through its syllables like a declaration of faith.

*Dereshishishi.*

A laugh that carried history. A laugh that defied editors.

A laugh that said, more clearly than any argument could have said: *the story is not over. The story is never over. The story continues as long as anyone is left to tell it.*

I am telling it now.

Perhaps that is what Saul was really teaching me.
