# Chapter Twelve: A Review of the Picaresque Romance "One Piece," with Observations on Its Theology, Its Violence, and the Curious Omissions of Its Author

## *Being a critical assessment composed by Severian, formerly of the Guild of Torturers, formerly Autarch of the Commonwealth, presently a pirate of no particular distinction*

---

I must begin with a confession that will color everything that follows: I do not understand how this document came to exist.

Robin found it in the wreckage of a Marine vessel we had... liberated of its supplies. Among the navigational charts and coded communications, there was a chest containing what I can only describe as illustrated manuscripts—thin volumes, cheaply bound, their pages covered in sequential images accompanied by text in a language I did not recognize but which, impossibly, I found I could read. The script bore no resemblance to any I had encountered in the Citadel's library, yet the meaning arrived in my mind as clearly as if I had studied it from childhood.

More disturbing still: the manuscripts told the story of our crew.

Not precisely—I will enumerate the divergences shortly—but recognizably. There was Luffy, rendered in bold lines, his grin capturing something essential about his nature that no portrait could have achieved. There was Zoro with his three swords, Nami with her maps, Robin with her darkness and her flowers. There was the Going Merry, sailing seas I had sailed. There were enemies I had faced, islands I had visited, battles I had fought.

And there was no Severian.

I searched every volume, examined every frame with the attention my guild training had instilled. I do not appear. Not as a peripheral figure, not as a background face in a crowd scene, not even as an unnamed silhouette. In the story these manuscripts tell, I do not exist.

I am still uncertain what to make of this. Either the documents describe a version of events that occurred before my arrival—a timeline I have since altered by my presence—or they describe a version of events that will never occur because my presence has already altered it. Or, most troublingly, they describe the *true* story, and I am the fiction, the interpolation, the character who has wandered into a narrative where he does not belong.

Regardless: I have read them. All of them, or all that the chest contained—some thirty-odd volumes covering events from Luffy's childhood through our confrontation with Crocodile in the desert kingdom. And I find I have opinions.

I will set those opinions down here, as I have set down everything else in this account. Let the reader judge their merit.

## On the Question of Form

The manuscripts belong to a category of literature I have not previously encountered, though the Citadel's library contained works that approached it. The sequential images suggest the illuminated manuscripts of the religious orders, where scenes from the Conciliator's life were depicted in panels surrounded by decorative borders. But those manuscripts used images to supplement text; here, the images *are* the text, carrying the primary weight of narrative while the words serve mainly to clarify action and convey dialogue.

The effect is curious. On one hand, the form permits a compression of storytelling that prose cannot match. A battle that would require pages of description to convey in words can be communicated in a single image—the positions of the combatants, the force of their blows, the expressions on their faces all apprehended simultaneously rather than sequentially. This grants the author a kind of temporal freedom that I, as a narrator bound to the linearity of language, cannot help but envy.

On the other hand, the form imposes constraints that prose escapes. I cannot access the interiority of these characters as I can access my own. When Luffy fights, I see his body move, but I do not hear his thoughts; I must infer his mental state from posture and expression, as one infers the mind of a stranger on the street. This produces a strange flattening. The Luffy of these manuscripts is recognizably the captain I serve, but he is also less than that captain—a public Luffy, a Luffy of surfaces, whose depths remain inaccessible because the form cannot plumb them.

I wonder if this is intentional. The author—whose name, rendered in the alien script, appears to be something like "Oda"—may be making a point about the nature of heroism. Heroes, in most traditions, are defined by their actions rather than their reflections. We do not ask what Donatello thought while hunting the Pirate King's treasure; we ask what he *did*. The form that privileges action over interiority may be the appropriate form for tales of heroic adventure.

But I confess I miss the interiority. I miss the moment between stimulus and response, the gap where choice occurs. The Luffy of these manuscripts seems to act without deciding—his choices arriving fully formed, as if he were not a man making decisions but a force of nature expressing its essential properties. This is inspiring, perhaps, but it is not quite human.

Or perhaps it is more than human. Perhaps that is the point.

## On the Treatment of Violence

I read these manuscripts with professional interest.

The guild trained me in violence as a craft, a discipline, an art form requiring precision and restraint. We understood that suffering had textures, that pain came in varieties, that the application of force to the human body could produce effects as varied as the application of paint to canvas. Our work was ugly, yes—I do not seek to excuse it—but it was *careful*. We knew what we were doing. We attended to consequences.

The violence in these manuscripts is not careful. It is exuberant, joyful, almost playful—fists flying, bodies hurtling through walls and across landscapes, impacts that should shatter bone depicted with a kind of aesthetic pleasure that disturbs me in ways I find difficult to articulate.

And yet the consequences are strangely muted. Characters who receive blows that would kill any human I have known stand up afterward, perhaps bloodied, perhaps bandaged in the next scene, but fundamentally unharmed. The accumulation of damage seems to follow different rules than those I learned in my training. Pain exists, clearly—characters cry out, wince, collapse—but it does not *persist*. It does not transform. The body in these manuscripts is not a record of what has been done to it; it is a renewable resource, always available for the next battle.

I recognize the theological implications of this choice.

In my world, violence was sacramental. It marked. It changed. The client who left our care was not the client who entered; the suffering we administered wrote itself upon their flesh and soul in ways that could not be erased. This was, in a sense, the *point*—the visible proof that justice had been done, that the scales had been balanced, that something real had happened that could not be undone.

But in this author's world, violence is not sacramental. It is *dramatic*. It exists to reveal character, to test resolve, to provide the occasion for triumph—but not to transform in the permanent way that real violence transforms. The body heals. The story continues. The wounds that should have ended everything become merely episodes in an ongoing adventure.

I do not know whether to call this optimism or evasion.

On one hand, it permits a kind of moral clarity that my experience denies. Luffy can fight, and fight, and fight again, without accumulating the psychic weight that such fighting should produce. He remains innocent in a way that no real warrior can remain innocent. His violence does not corrupt him because his violence does not truly *cost* anything—not to him, not in the long run.

On the other hand, it seems to me a lie. A beautiful lie, perhaps. A necessary lie, for a tale meant to inspire rather than devastate. But a lie nonetheless. The real Luffy I have sailed with carries scars I do not see in these images—not on his body, but in the particular quality of his silences, in the way his laughter sometimes sounds like defiance against something he will not name. The manuscripts capture his joy but not his grief. They show him winning without showing what winning costs.

Perhaps this is why I do not appear in them. My presence would introduce the weight they have chosen to exclude. I am a reminder that violence marks, that pain persists, that the bodies we inhabit keep records our minds would prefer to forget.

I am the sacramental note in what is meant to be a dramatic song.

## On the Question of the Author's Theology

This is the matter that most concerns me, and on which I find I have the most to say.

The author of these manuscripts has constructed a world, and every constructed world implies a theology—a set of assumptions about what matters, what is possible, what forces govern existence. Even worlds that deny God make theological claims in their denial. The question is not whether a theology is present but what theology it is.

The theology of these manuscripts, as best I can discern it, is a theology of *will*.

Everything in this world bends toward will. The Devil Fruits grant power, but the power is only as effective as the will that wields it. Haki is will made manifest—literally, explicitly, the imposition of one's intention upon reality. The great figures of this world are not those with the most resources or the best positions but those with the strongest wills: pirates who refuse to accept limits, revolutionaries who refuse to accept authority, even Marines whose rigid dedication to their cause gives them a kind of monstrous effectiveness.

And at the center of it all stands Luffy, whose will is so pure, so undivided, so absolute in its commitment that it functions almost as a natural law. He wants to be Pirate King; therefore, he will be Pirate King. The connection between desire and outcome is not mediated by probability or circumstance but by the sheer *force* of his wanting. He bends the world through belief.

This is, I recognize, a kind of theology. It is not the theology of the Increate—there is no uncaused cause here, no ground of being beneath the beings, no source from which will derives its authority. Will simply *is*, self-justifying, self-authorizing, requiring nothing beyond itself to validate its claims.

But it is not atheism either. Or rather, it is an atheism that produces religious effects. The will that Luffy embodies inspires the same responses that the Conciliator inspired in my world: devotion, imitation, transformation of life around the central example. His crew follows him not because he commands—he barely commands at all—but because his certainty creates a field in which their own certainties can flourish. He is a saint of willfulness, a prophet of wanting, and his gospel is simple: decide what you desire, and refuse to desire anything else.

I find this theology both attractive and troubling.

Attractive because it offers a dignity that more deterministic worldviews deny. If will is fundamental—if the cosmos can be bent by sufficiently powerful wanting—then we are not victims of our circumstances, not puppets of forces beyond our control, not the playthings of gods or governments or the impersonal grinding of material causation. We are *agents*, makers of meaning, authors of our own stories.

This is, I think, what Luffy offers his crew: not protection (though he provides that) but *permission*. Permission to want what they want. Permission to pursue dreams that the world calls impossible. Permission to believe that their wills matter, that their choices count, that the universe is not indifferent to their striving.

But the theology is troubling too, and the trouble lies in what it cannot account for: failure.

---

In my world, failure was the norm. The sun was dying; most efforts to save it had come to nothing; the Commonwealth itself was a ruin of a ruin, a civilization that had forgotten it was descended from civilizations that had forgotten their own origins. We lived among the debris of abandoned ambitions, reminded daily that will was not enough, that wanting did not make a thing so, that the universe was under no obligation to reward even the most sincere effort with success.

The Conciliator himself had failed, in a sense. He came to heal and was killed for his healing. His gifts persisted—the Claw, the promise of the New Sun—but he did not live to see them fulfilled. The theology of my world made room for this. It insisted that failure was not final, that the Increate worked through means we could not perceive, that what looked like defeat might be victory in a register we were not equipped to read.

But this author's theology has no room for permanent failure. Not really. Not for the protagonists, anyway. Luffy loses battles, yes—loses badly, sometimes, is beaten and broken and left for dead. But he never loses *wars*. He always rises. He always returns. His will may be checked temporarily, but it cannot be finally defeated, because his will is the engine of the narrative itself, and a narrative that permanently defeats its own engine is a narrative that ends.

This is not theology. This is *wish fulfillment*.

I say this not as criticism—or not only as criticism. Wish fulfillment has its place. Stories that grant us the victories life denies can be sustaining, can be necessary, can provide the imaginative fuel for efforts that would otherwise seem hopeless. If I had read these manuscripts as a boy in the Citadel, I would have been encouraged by them. I would have dreamed of being Luffy, of bending the world through sheer refusal to accept its refusals.

But I am not a boy anymore. I have lived. I have failed. I have seen the people I loved die despite all my willing otherwise. And I cannot read this theology without noting what it excludes: the possibility that sometimes, despite everything, the desired outcome simply does not arrive. That will is not always enough. That the universe, finally, is not a story with a protagonist whose survival is guaranteed by the needs of narrative.

The author—Oda—has created a world where will is almost always sufficient, where failure is almost always temporary, where the right amount of determination can overcome nearly any obstacle. It is a beautiful world. It is an inspiring world. It is not, I think, a *true* world—not true to the one I lived in, not true to the one I live in now.

But perhaps truth is not what such stories are for. Perhaps they are for something else: hope, or courage, or the reminder that, even if will is not always enough, it is always *necessary*—always the place to start, always better than despair.

## On the Curious Omission of the Inner Life

I have mentioned this already, but I wish to dwell on it further, because it touches on questions of craft that concern me as a narrator.

The author of these manuscripts does not give us his characters' thoughts.

This is, in some sense, a limitation of the form—the sequential images cannot easily convey interiority, and the text that accompanies them is devoted primarily to dialogue and action. But I suspect it is also a choice. The characters in these manuscripts do not reflect because they do not *need* to reflect. They know what they want; they act to obtain it; the gap between desire and action that produces thought in ordinary humans does not seem to exist for them.

This is, again, both admirable and troubling.

Admirable because it produces clarity. There is no confusion about what these characters want or who they are. Luffy wants to be Pirate King; Zoro wants to be the world's greatest swordsman; Nami wants to map every sea. These desires are stated openly, repeated frequently, and pursued with a consistency that makes the characters legible in ways that real humans rarely are.

But troubling because it suggests that the inner life is dispensable—that the self is fully constituted by its desires and actions, with no remainder, no excess, no surplus of being that escapes into reflection or doubt or the simple experience of existing. The characters in these manuscripts do not seem to *be* when they are not doing. They do not lie awake at night wondering about the nature of existence. They do not write journals trying to make sense of their experiences. They do not philosophize.

I recognize that this is an unfair criticism. I am, after all, a man who narrates everything—who cannot stop reflecting, who experiences his life as a continuous commentary upon itself. My standard for interiority is not universal. Many people live more like Luffy than like me, acting without excessive analysis, trusting their instincts, allowing their bodies to carry them through situations that would paralyze a more reflective temperament.

And yet I find I *want* to know what Luffy thinks. Not his conscious thoughts, necessarily—I suspect he does not have many of those—but the texture of his experience, the quality of his consciousness, what it feels like from the inside to be a person whose will is so perfectly unified with his action. Is there peace there? Is there joy? Is there an undercurrent of fear that the certainty might fail, that the will might not be enough, that the universe might finally refuse to bend?

The manuscripts do not tell me. They show me a figure of absolute confidence, but they do not let me inside that confidence to understand how it is maintained. Luffy remains, despite hundreds of pages of illustration, a mystery—known by his effects but not by his essence.

Perhaps this is also theology. The god who can be fully comprehended ceases to be a god; the mystery that can be solved ceases to be a mystery. Luffy's opacity may be the same opacity that saints have always presented to their followers: we know them by their miracles, their teachings, their examples, but the inner fire that animates them remains invisible, experienced only by the saint himself, conveyed only through the inadequate medium of action.

## On the Treatment of Female Characters

I must address this, though it sits uncomfortably with me.

The women in these manuscripts are, by any reasonable assessment, formidable. Nami is brilliant, cunning, capable of navigating physical and social situations with equal skill. Robin is a scholar whose knowledge would be envied by the masters of the Citadel's library. The enemies include women of tremendous power—warriors, rulers, strategists.

And yet.

The illustrations depict these women in ways that trouble me. Their bodies are rendered with an emphasis on certain features that seems... gratuitous. Their poses often suggest display rather than action. Even in battle, even in moments of triumph, the images seem aware of them as objects of regard in ways that the images of male characters do not.

I am not certain how to articulate my discomfort. I am not a prude—the guild exposed me to the human body in all its variations, and I lost whatever squeamishness I might have had before I lost my milk teeth. But there is a difference between depicting bodies and *displaying* them, between acknowledging physical presence and emphasizing it for purposes that serve the viewer rather than the character.

The Nami I sail with does not stand the way the Nami of these manuscripts stands. The Robin I have come to trust does not present herself for assessment in the way these images present her. The real women are *persons*, fully inhabiting their bodies as instruments of their will; the illustrated women are somehow both more and less than persons—more visually emphatic, less ontologically solid.

I suspect this reflects something about the audience the author anticipates. These manuscripts are produced for sale, Robin tells me—commercial objects, created to generate revenue. They must please their readers, and those readers are apparently pleased by the display of female bodies in particular configurations. The author gives them what they want.

But what they want seems to me a diminishment. And I note it here because truth requires noting it, even when the noting is uncomfortable.

## On What the Author Has Achieved

I have catalogued my criticisms at length. Let me now acknowledge what deserves acknowledgment.

The author of these manuscripts has created a world.

This is no small thing. I have read many books, in the Citadel's library and beyond, and most of them operate within worlds already created—the world of the Commonwealth, the world of Urth, the world that readers and writers share. But this author has built something new: a geography, a history, a system of powers and politics, a cast of hundreds, an interlocking set of mysteries whose eventual resolution the reader is invited to anticipate.

The scale is impressive. The consistency is impressive. The sheer *accumulation* of detail—islands, characters, techniques, histories, each one rendered distinctly, each one contributing to a whole that is larger than any of its parts—represents a labor I can only admire, whatever my reservations about particular choices.

And the author understands something essential about storytelling: that stories require both pattern and surprise. The patterns are clear—the progression from challenge to challenge, the gradual expansion of the crew, the recurring confrontations with representatives of the World Government. But within those patterns, genuine surprises occur. Reversals I did not anticipate. Revelations that recontextualize what came before. Moments of emotional impact that earned their effect through careful preparation.

I am moved, sometimes, by these manuscripts. Despite the flatness I have criticized, despite the theological simplifications I have noted, despite the curious omissions and troubling emphases—I am moved. When Nami begged for help and Luffy placed his hat on her head, I felt something. When Robin screamed her desire to live, I felt something—felt it more intensely, perhaps, because I had lived through the actual event and could compare it to its depiction.

The author has made something that *works*, at the fundamental level where stories succeed or fail. It produces the responses it intends to produce. It carries the reader forward, from page to page, from volume to volume, eager to learn what happens next. This is craft. This is skill. This is the rare achievement of a creator who understands not just what to put on the page but how to arrange it so that the putting-on achieves its effects.

## Conclusion: On the Strangeness of Being Reviewed

I set down my pen and look at what I have written, and I am struck by the absurdity of my position.

I am a character reviewing my own story.

Not my *own* own—the story in these manuscripts is not the story I have been living, not quite. But it is close enough that the act of criticism becomes strange, self-referential, a loop that threatens to collapse into paradox. Who am I to judge the world I inhabit? Who am I to critique the author who has (in some sense? in no sense?) created the conditions of my existence?

And yet the urge to judge persists. Because I am not only a character; I am also a consciousness, a perspective, a being who experiences from the inside what the author depicts from the outside. I know things about this world that the manuscripts do not contain—things about the texture of the sea air, the precise quality of Luffy's laugh, the weight of Terminus Est in my hand. I know what it feels like to stand on the Going Merry's deck at night, watching stars I do not recognize, wondering how I came to be so far from everything I knew.

These knowledges give me standing, I think. Standing to say: here is what the author got right. Here is what the author got wrong. Here is what the author does not seem to know, or does not care to depict, or has chosen to exclude for reasons I can only guess at.

I do not know if the author will ever read this review. I do not know if the author could read it—if the boundary between his world and mine permits communication in that direction. But I write it anyway, as I write everything, because the writing is how I understand.

And what I understand, finally, is this:

The author has created a world where will is almost sufficient, where failure is almost always temporary, where the right kind of determination can almost always overcome. It is a kinder world than the one I came from. It is a more hopeful world than the one I lived in when I served the guild and sat upon the Phoenix Throne.

And I—who was not created for this world, who wandered into it from somewhere else, who carry within me memories and weights that do not fit the narrative's shape—

I am grateful for the kindness. I am grateful for the hope. I am grateful for the world where Luffy's will is enough, even if I know, from my own experience, that will is not always enough, that sometimes the desired outcome simply does not arrive.

Perhaps that is what I am for: to remind this world that there are other worlds. That the theology of will, beautiful as it is, is not the only theology. That failure is possible, and must be reckoned with, and does not invalidate the effort that preceded it.

Perhaps I am the note of tragedy in a comic epic.

Perhaps I am the weight that makes the weightlessness meaningful.

Or perhaps I am simply a man with opinions, reading a story that is not quite his story, finding in its pages both recognition and estrangement, and setting down his responses in the only way he knows how:

Word by word, sentence by sentence, truth by halting truth.

The Increate—if it exists—will judge whether I have judged fairly.

The author—if he exists in any way I can communicate with—is welcome to respond.

*I award the work three and one-half stars out of a possible five. The craftsmanship is evident, the theology is questionable, and I remain uncertain whether my absence from its pages reflects a deficiency in the narrative or a mercy I should be grateful for.*
