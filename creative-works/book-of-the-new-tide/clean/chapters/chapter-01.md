## Chapter One: The Sea That Eats Memory

It is important, if my account is to be credited by those who will read it in some distant age, that I record here a simple truth: I did not intend to cross the sea. I who had walked the corridors of time itself, who had carried the Claw of the Conciliator unknowing through the streets of Nessus, who had stood before the Hierogrammates in their ship that sailed between the stars—I had never learned to swim.

This confession may seem trivial to those born in the archipelago I have come to know, where children take to water as naturally as the people of the Commonwealth take to earth. But for one raised in the shadow of the Citadel, where the Gyoll ran dark and corpse-laden past our walls, water was a thing associated with death and the disposal of death's leavings. Master Gurloes once told me that the torturers of the elder days used drowning as an expedient, though we of the guild considered it inelegant—too swift, leaving no lasting mark upon the flesh to testify to justice rendered.

I set this down because it explains my terror when I woke to find myself adrift.

The vessel—if vessel it could be called—was no larger than one of the punts the fishermen of Gyoll used in those stretches of the river too shallow for proper boats. Yet it held me, and held too the few possessions I had carried: Terminus Est in her worn scabbard, my fuligin cloak now salt-stained and stiff as old leather, and a single book whose pages had become so water-warped that its text (a treatise on the cultivation of avern, which I had been reading in the antechamber of the House Absolute before—but I will come to that) was nearly illegible.

The sky above me was not the sky I knew.

I have seen many skies. The bruised purple heavens of Urth beneath her dying sun. The star-pricked blackness visible from the deck of Tzadkiel's ship. The amber twilight that hangs perpetual over the gardens of the House Absolute. But this sky was blue—achingly, impossibly blue—of a shade I had seen only in the oldest paintings preserved in the Citadel's collection, works so ancient that their pigments had faded to mere suggestions of what they once conveyed. And the sun that hung in that sky burned white-gold, fierce and young, pouring down heat of a kind I had never felt.

I understood then, in the way one understands such things in dreams before the waking mind catches up with knowledge, that I was no longer on Urth at all.

The current carried me for what might have been hours or days—time moved strangely on that sea, stretching and compressing in ways that reminded me of my journeys through the Corridors beneath the Second House. I slept, woke, slept again. Thirst became my companion, then my torturer (and I understood torture as few others could), and finally my teacher. I learned to catch the morning dew on my cloak, wringing drops of moisture into my parched mouth. I learned that the fish of that sea, unlike those of the Gyoll, were edible raw, though their flesh tasted of nothing I could name.

On what I believe was the third day, I saw the ship.

It was not a ship as the autarchs built them, those massive war-vessels powered by energies drawn from the sun itself. Nor was it like the fishing boats of Nessus, humble craft of wood and tar. This ship seemed to exist in a category entirely its own: vast and fanciful, its prow carved in the likeness of some beast I did not recognize—a creature with a lion's mane and the grinning visage of a gargoyle, rendered in wood painted the yellow of summer wheat. Sails billowed above it, sails the color of fresh blood, and upon those sails was emblazoned a skull wearing a peculiar hat made of straw.

I had time to observe all this because the ship was sinking.

Or rather, it appeared to be sinking, having struck a reef whose teeth jutted from the water like the fangs of some submarine leviathan. Figures moved upon its deck—human figures, I thought, though at such distance I could not be certain—and their cries carried across the water, thin and desperate as the keening of clients in the third level of our oubliette.

I am not, as I have said, a man given to swimming. But I had been an executioner, and before that an apprentice, and before that a child who had learned one essential truth: that survival often depends upon actions we would not otherwise choose. I rolled from my small vessel into the warm sea, keeping one hand upon the gunwale, and began to kick.

The woman who pulled me from the water had hair the color of tangerines.

I record this detail because it struck me with peculiar force—such a shade of orange I had never seen on a human head, bright as the flames of the Pelerines' sacred fire. She was young, perhaps twenty of the years such as they count them in this world (which differ, I later learned, only negligibly from our own), and her eyes held the sharp intelligence of a librarian or a poisoner.

"Luffy!" she shouted, and her voice carried the particular resonance of command I associated with the highest echelons of the guild. "There's someone in the water!"

More faces appeared above me: a young man with a scar beneath his eye and a grin so wide it seemed to split his face entire; another man, longer of limb and nose, whose posture spoke of perpetual anxiety; a third whose green hair marked him as surely exotic as the woman's orange. They hauled me up as one might haul a waterlogged corpse, with efficiency born of practice, and deposited me upon a deck that creaked and groaned with the ship's dying.

"Oi," said the grinning one, the one they had called Luffy. He peered at me with an intensity that reminded me uncomfortably of the scrutiny I had once endured from Father Inire, that ancient and inscrutable servant of the Autarch. "What's with the black coat? Are you a Marine?"

I did not know what a Marine was, in the sense he meant it. I said, "I am a journeyman of the Order of the Seekers for Truth and Penitence."

Silence greeted this pronouncement—the particular silence that follows when one has said something either incomprehensible or obscene. The green-haired man's hand drifted toward one of the three swords at his hip (three! I had never seen a man carry three swords; even the most ostentatious armiger of the Citadel contented himself with one), and the orange-haired woman took a step backward.

"A torturer," I clarified, for I had learned long ago that the guild's formal title meant nothing to those outside its walls. "Though I am no longer in the guild's service."

The one called Luffy laughed. It was not the laugh of derision I had expected—the laugh that had followed me through the streets of Nessus, the laugh of those who saw my fuligin and knew what it signified. His laugh was pure as a child's, unmarred by judgment or fear.

"A torturer! That's so cool!" He turned to his companions with evident delight. "Nami, Usopp, Zoro—we found a torturer! Hey, torturer-guy, can you cook?"

"I—" I began, but the ship chose that moment to shudder with a violence that threw us all to our knees. Water was pouring through the hull now, faster than any pump could manage, and I understood that we had minutes at best before the vessel joined the countless wrecks that must litter the floor of this strange sea.

What happened next I must record as faithfully as I can, though I confess that even my memory—which has never failed me—struggles to encompass it.

The young man, Luffy, extended his arm toward the distant shore.

I say extended; what I mean is that his arm *stretched*, elongating like hot tallow, like the neck of a swan drawn by a child's uncertain hand, until it reached a distance no human limb should be capable of reaching. His fingers closed around a rocky outcropping perhaps fifty meters distant, and then—then his body followed, pulling after his arm like thread through a needle's eye, carrying with it all of us who had grabbed hold of him on instinct or instruction.

We flew through the air, the lot of us, screaming (I confess that I screamed; it would be dishonest to pretend otherwise), and landed in a heap upon the shore as the ship behind us gave its final groan and slipped beneath the waves.

I had seen many strange things in my life. I had seen the alzabo that spoke with the voices of those it had consumed. I had seen the undines who dwelt in the waters of the House Absolute, neither quite human nor quite fish. I had seen Baldanders in his transformation, and the Hierogrammates in their true forms, and the Claw of the Conciliator work miracles upon the dead and dying.

But I had never seen a man stretch like rubber.

"Devil Fruit," the woman—Nami—explained to me, when we had caught our breath and taken stock of our situation. We sat upon a beach of black sand (volcanic in origin, I would later learn, though at the time I thought of the black beaches described in the legend of the Last Deluge), watching the last bubbles of the sunken ship rise and burst upon the surface. "Luffy ate the Gum-Gum Fruit when he was a kid. It made him a rubber man."

"A fruit," I repeated. "That grants the power to... stretch?"

"Among other things." She eyed me with the wariness I had come to expect, though now it seemed tempered by the fact that I had shared their vessel's doom and their unlikely rescue. "There are hundreds of Devil Fruits, each with different powers. But everyone who eats one loses the ability to swim."

This last detail struck me as significant, though I could not then articulate why. A power that grants abilities while stripping away others—this was a bargain I understood well. Had I not made such bargains myself, again and again? Had not the guild itself been such a bargain, offering purpose and position in exchange for one's place among ordinary humanity?

"Then he is cursed," I said, looking at the young man who even now was shouting about meat and adventure, seemingly untroubled by the loss of his ship. "As I am cursed."

"Cursed?" Nami's eyebrow arched. "Is that what you call it?"

I drew back my cloak—that cloak of fuligin, the color darker than black, which marks the servants of the torturer's guild—and let her see Terminus Est at my hip. Her eyes widened; she knew quality when she saw it, I could tell. The blade that had taken so many heads, the blade that contained the channel of mercury that gave it weight in the downstroke.

"I carry the deaths of all those I have executed," I told her. "And I carry too the memories of others—those who have died, whose final thoughts were fed to me through means I will not describe here. The guild's justice walks with me always. If that is not a curse, then the word has no meaning."

She was silent for a moment. Then, unexpectedly, she smiled—a small smile, wry and knowing.

"You'll fit right in," she said.

So began my time among the Straw Hat pirates, though I did not know then that they were called pirates, nor that the world into which I had fallen was one in which such distinctions mattered greatly. I knew only that I was far from Urth, far from the Commonwealth, far from any place I had ever known or imagined—and that for reasons I did not yet understand, I was not alone.

In the chapters that follow, I shall record what I learned of this world and its wonders: of the Grand Line that divides the seas, of the fruits of the devil and the will called Haki, of the Marine Admirals and the Pirate Emperors and the great treasure that all seek and none have found. I shall tell of battles fought and friends made and enemies whose enmity I earned in the full measure of my gifts.

But first I must tell of the boy with the straw hat—of Monkey D. Luffy, who laughed at death and reached for the impossible—and of how he came to show me something I had thought myself incapable of perceiving: hope that was not merely the absence of despair.

I, Severian the Lame, once called Severian the Apprentice and later Severian Autarch, record these things in the full knowledge that no one who reads them will believe them entirely. I can only swear, as I have sworn before, that I have set down nothing that is not true.

Whether truth itself is trustworthy is a question I leave to philosophers.
