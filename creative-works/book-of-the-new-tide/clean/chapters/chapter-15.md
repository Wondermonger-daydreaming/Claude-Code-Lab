# Chapter Fifteen: The Prince in the Underworld

I descended into the roots of the world.

This is not metaphor—or not entirely. The Underworld of Elbaf lies beneath the great tree called Adam, whose trunk rises so high that its crown vanishes into clouds that never disperse, whose roots extend so deep that they pierce the bedrock of the island and reach into caverns that have never known light. To descend into those roots is to descend, quite literally, into the foundations of things.

The giants call it the Realm of the Dead, though the dead do not dwell there. What dwells there is older than death: the beasts that existed before the giants came, the darkness that preceded the first fire, the silence that remembers when nothing had yet learned to speak.

And Loki.

---

I should explain how I came to be here.

(Or perhaps I should not. The reader has followed my account through many digressions, and may have grown weary of my habit of providing context before arriving at substance. But I cannot help myself. The guild trained us to approach every situation with full knowledge of its antecedents; to act without understanding the history of one's action was, in Master Palaemon's words, to wield a blade without knowing which end was hilt and which was edge.)

We had arrived in Elbaf three days prior, carried by the Giant Warrior Pirates through seas that seemed, to my perception, calmer than any we had sailed before. The welcome had been warm—feasts and songs and the particular hospitality of beings for whom generosity is not virtue but simply nature, as natural as breathing, as unremarkable as the rising of the sun.

But beneath the welcome, I sensed tension. The giants spoke of their prince with voices that dropped, with gazes that slid away, with the particular careful neutrality that I recognized from my years in the Commonwealth—the way citizens spoke of the Autarch, the way clients spoke of each other in the antechambers of the guild.

They spoke of him as the Accursed Prince. The Shame of Elbaf. The one who had murdered his father for a Devil Fruit, who had slaughtered a hundred and thirteen soldiers in the royal castle, who had been captured by Red-Haired Shanks and chained in the Underworld where he could harm no one else.

They spoke of him as a monster.

I have known monsters. I have been called one myself. And I have learned that the word "monster" often tells you more about the speaker than the spoken-of.

So when Luffy announced that he intended to visit the prisoner—announced it casually, as though visiting condemned royalty in subterranean prisons were an ordinary afternoon activity—I asked to accompany him.

He looked at me with that expression I have come to know well: the slight tilt of the head, the widening of the eyes, the moment of assessment that passes so quickly most people miss it entirely.

"You want to meet Loki?"

"I want to understand him."

"That's different from meeting."

"Yes," I agreed. "It is."

He grinned. "Okay. But if he tries to eat you, I'm not saving you."

"I would not expect you to."

"Good. Let's go."

---

The descent took hours.

The path wound through roots thicker than the towers of the Citadel, through chambers where bioluminescent fungi cast shadows that moved when I was not looking directly at them, through passages so narrow that even I—not a large man, by any standard—had to turn sideways to pass. Luffy, with his rubber body, simply compressed himself and bounced through; I followed with more difficulty and considerably less dignity.

The beasts the giants had warned us of made themselves known gradually. First as sounds: rustling in the darkness, breathing that was too large to be anything natural, the click of claws on stone. Then as presences: shapes at the edge of my Observation Haki, massive and hostile and *watching*. They did not attack. I do not know if this was because of Luffy's presence, or because they recognized something in me—some kinship of darkness, some fellow-feeling among creatures who have learned to live where light does not reach.

Or perhaps they simply were not hungry. One should not attribute to mysticism what can be explained by the practical considerations of digestion.

The prison, when we reached it, was not what I expected.

I had imagined chains. Iron bars. The apparatus of confinement that I knew from the oubliettes beneath the Citadel, where clients awaited their sessions in darkness so complete that many lost their minds before we ever touched them.

Instead, I found a garden.

---

The chamber was vast—larger than any enclosed space I had seen since the Hall of Sounding in the House Absolute, where the Autarchs of old had received petitioners from across the Commonwealth. Its ceiling was lost in shadow; its walls were formed by the intertwined roots of the great tree, creating patterns that suggested intention, design, the deliberate architecture of a mind that thought in centuries rather than years.

And in the center of the chamber, surrounded by flowers that should not have been able to grow without sunlight, sat a giant.

He was chained, yes. The chains were massive—links larger than my entire body, forged from a metal that seemed to drink the light rather than reflect it. They bound his wrists and ankles, his throat and waist, connecting him to the roots that formed the chamber's walls. He could not move more than a few feet in any direction.

But within that limited radius, he had made a garden.

Flowers grew from cracks in the stone floor—impossible flowers, varieties I did not recognize, colors that seemed to shift when I looked at them directly. Vines climbed the chains that bound him, softening their harsh lines with leaves and blossoms. Small creatures moved among the plants: insects, I thought at first, but when I looked closer I saw they were something else, something that had adapted to this lightless place and evolved forms that had no equivalent in the sunlit world above.

And Loki himself—

His eyes were bound. Bandages wrapped around the upper half of his face, covering whatever lay beneath. But he turned toward us as we entered, tracking our movement with a precision that made clear the blindfold was not a limitation.

"The Sun God," he said. His voice was deep, resonant, carrying harmonics that seemed to vibrate in my chest. "And... someone else. Someone who doesn't belong here."

"That's Severian," Luffy said. "He's crew."

"Severian." Loki tested the name, rolling it across his tongue like a sommelier evaluating wine. "A strange name. Not from these seas."

"No," I agreed. "Not from these seas."

"And yet here you are. In the Underworld. Visiting the monster."

"I am told you are a monster," I said. "I am also told you murdered your father for power. I have learned to be skeptical of what I am told."

Loki laughed. The sound was startling—not the cruel laugh I had expected, not the bitter laugh of the condemned, but something that contained genuine amusement.

"Skeptical. That's a rare quality in visitors. Most come to gawk at the Accursed Prince, to see if my eyes are really as terrible as the stories say, to confirm their belief that I am everything they feared and nothing they hoped." He tilted his head, those bound eyes somehow finding mine. "Why are you skeptical?"

"Because I have been called a monster myself. And the word has rarely been accurate."

---

(I must pause here to note that I am not certain of the accuracy of what follows.

The conversation with Loki lasted several hours. Luffy, characteristically, lost interest in the verbal exchange within the first few minutes and began exploring the garden, poking at flowers, attempting to catch the strange insects, and eventually falling asleep in a pile of luminescent moss. This left Loki and me to talk alone—or as alone as one can be with a snoring rubber-man ten feet away.

I remember what was said. My memory does not fail. But memory and truth are not the same thing, and Loki—I came to understand—is a creature of stories, of narratives, of versions. He told me his history, but he told it as a storyteller tells, with emphasis and omission, with the shaping that transforms raw event into meaning.

I cannot be certain which parts were true, which were true-as-he-understood-them, and which were true-as-he-wished-them-to-be.

This uncertainty does not trouble me as much as it once would have. I have come to understand that all history is like this—not a record of what happened, but a story we tell about what happened, shaped by who is telling and who is listening and what both parties need the story to mean.)

---

"I did kill my father," Loki said. "That part of the story is true."

"And the Devil Fruit?"

"I ate it. That is also true." He raised one massive hand—the chain attached to his wrist clinked and shifted—and examined it as though seeing it for the first time. "But the order of events, the *reason* for events... that is where the story the giants tell diverges from the story I lived."

"Tell me the story you lived."

He was silent for a long moment. The flowers around him seemed to pulse gently, responding to some rhythm I could not perceive.

"My father was King Harald. He was... a good man. A reformer. He wanted Elbaf to join the world, to trade and negotiate and participate in the community of nations rather than remaining isolated in our strength. He opened schools. He built libraries. He believed that civilization was better than barbarism, that peace was preferable to war."

"These seem admirable goals."

"They were. They are." Loki's voice carried something I recognized—the particular tone of a child speaking of a parent they loved but did not entirely understand. "But he was naive. He believed that the World Government shared his values. He believed that if Elbaf showed good faith, the Government would reciprocate. He did not understand what he was dealing with."

"And what was he dealing with?"

"Monsters." The word came out flat, without emphasis. "Not monsters like me—not beings that the world calls monstrous because they are frightened of what they do not understand. Real monsters. Creatures that wear human faces and sit upon thrones and decide, from their position of absolute power, which peoples will be permitted to exist and which will be erased."

I thought of the Autarchs I had served. Of the Hierogrammates who had manipulated my world across centuries. Of the powers that operated behind every throne I had ever known.

"I understand," I said.

"Do you?" His head turned toward me, those bound eyes somehow conveying skepticism. "Do you understand what it means to watch your father—the man you love despite everything, despite his absence, despite his failures, despite the ways he never quite saw you—do you understand what it means to watch him become something else? To see a foreign will crawl into his body and wear his face while you stand there, helpless, knowing that the thing speaking with his voice is not him?"

I did not answer immediately.

I was thinking of Thecla. Of the alzabo, and what it had done to her memories, and how I had consumed them and carried them and become, in some sense, a vessel for a consciousness that was not entirely my own.

I was thinking of Baldanders, and the way the Hierogrammates had used him, shaped him, made him into something that served their purposes while believing he served his own.

I was thinking of myself, and all the ways I had been used, and the question I still could not answer: whether my choices had ever truly been mine, or whether I had always been a piece in a game played by intelligences I could not perceive.

"Yes," I said finally. "I understand."

---

"They have a power," Loki continued. "The ones who sit on the Empty Throne—or the one, I am no longer certain if they are many or one. They call it Domi Reversi. The reversal of dominion. It lets them reach into a person and... *take*. Take their will. Take their self. Replace what they were with what the power needs them to be."

"Possession."

"Worse than possession. Possession implies a separation between the possessor and the possessed. This is more like... rewriting. The person who was there is still there, somewhere, but they are buried beneath layers of foreign intention, and what moves and speaks and acts is something else wearing their face."

"And this happened to your father."

"He went to a meeting. A negotiation, he called it. The World Government wanted to discuss Elbaf's future, and he believed—he *believed*, that was always his weakness, his capacity for belief—that they wanted what he wanted. Peace. Cooperation. A place in the community of nations."

"But they wanted something else."

"They wanted *us*. The giants. Our strength. Our warriors. They wanted to add us to their arsenal, to make us into weapons they could point at their enemies. And when my father refused—when he understood, finally, what they were actually asking—they used the power on him."

Loki's hands clenched. The chains groaned.

"He came back different. The giants did not see it—they saw their beloved king, a little tired perhaps, a little changed by his journey, but still Harald. But I saw. I had been watching him my whole life, watching and waiting and hoping that someday he would *see* me, really see me, not as the accursed child but as his son. I knew every expression he made, every gesture, every inflection of his voice. And I knew that what came back was not him."

---

"What did you do?"

"What could I do? I was the Accursed Prince. No one would have believed me if I had spoken. They would have said I was trying to undermine my father, that my evil nature was finally revealing itself, that the curse of my birth was manifesting in paranoid delusions."

"So you waited."

"I watched. I gathered evidence. I tried to find moments when my father—the *real* my father—surfaced through whatever was controlling him. They came, sometimes. Brief flickers. A look in his eye that was his own. A phrase that belonged to the man I remembered. And in those moments, I saw..."

He trailed off. The garden around him seemed to dim, the flowers closing slightly, the luminescence fading.

"What did you see?"

"Terror. He was trapped inside his own body, watching something else use his hands and speak with his mouth, and he was *terrified*. And he was fighting. Every moment, he was fighting to break free, to warn us, to do something—anything—to stop what was happening."

"Did he succeed?"

"Once." Loki's voice dropped. "Just once. For perhaps a minute, perhaps less. He broke through the control and he looked at me—*really* looked at me, for the first time in my life he looked at me and saw me—and he begged me to kill him."

---

The silence that followed was the silence of the Underworld itself: absolute, waiting, patient as stone.

"He said they were going to use him to destroy Elbaf," Loki continued. "That the thing wearing his face was going to open our gates to our enemies, betray our secrets, turn our strength into a weapon against ourselves. He said the only way to stop it was to end him before the plan could be completed. He said—"

His voice cracked. It was strange, hearing that crack in such a vast voice, seeing such a massive being reveal such a human fragility.

"He said he was sorry. For not being there. For not protecting me from my mother's cruelty, from my uncle's abuse, from the years of being called accursed by the people who should have loved me. He said he had always loved me, even when he could not show it, even when the distance between us seemed impossible to cross. And he asked me to do the one thing a son should never have to do."

"You killed him."

"I killed him. With Jarul as witness—old Jarul, who had been his friend since childhood, who understood what was happening even if he could not explain it. I killed my father, and I ate the Devil Fruit that was our family's heirloom, because he asked me to, because it was the only way to ensure the power did not fall into the hands of the Government, and then I—"

He stopped.

"Then you let them blame you."

"What else could I do? If I had told the truth, I would have had to explain about the possession, about the power, about the shadow that sits on the Empty Throne. No one would have believed me. And even if they had—even if I could have convinced them—what would it have accomplished? My father's legacy would have been destroyed. The king they loved would have been revealed as a puppet, a tool, a victim. Better for them to remember him as he was. Better for them to hate me than to doubt him."

---

I sat with this for a long time.

Around us, the garden continued its slow, patient cycles. The flowers opened and closed in rhythms that had nothing to do with any sun. The strange insects went about their incomprehensible business. Luffy snored.

"You chose to carry a lie," I said finally.

"I chose to carry a *truth*. Just not the truth the world wanted to hear."

"That is not what I meant." I leaned forward, trying to find words for something I had never articulated, even to myself. "In my world, I served as an executioner. We called ourselves torturers, but the purpose was the same: to end lives that the state had decided should be ended. And there was a woman—a client, we called them, though the word was a euphemism—who was condemned to death for crimes against the Autarch."

"You loved her."

"Yes. And when her suffering became unbearable—when the techniques of my guild had broken her in ways that could not be healed—I gave her a knife. I gave her the means to end her own pain, because I could not bear to watch her endure any more."

"That sounds like mercy."

"That is what I told myself. For years, that is what I believed. But I have come to understand that it was also cowardice. I gave her a knife because I could not bring myself to defy the system that had condemned her. I gave her death because I could not imagine giving her *life*—could not imagine burning the flag of the Commonwealth, standing against everything I had been raised to serve, demanding that she be asked if she wished to live."

Loki was silent.

"Your captain did that," I continued. "At a place called Enies Lobby. A woman who had given up on life, who believed she had no right to exist, who had surrendered to the very powers you describe—he burned the flag of the World Government and demanded that she claim her right to live. He did not offer her a knife. He offered her a *choice*."

"And you think I should have done the same? For my father?"

"I think—" I paused, trying to be precise. "I think we both made the only choices we could make, given who we were and what we understood. But I also think that both of us will spend the rest of our lives wondering if there was another way. If the mercy we offered was really mercy, or if it was simply the easiest path through an impossible situation."

---

Loki laughed again—a different laugh this time, darker and more tired.

"You are a strange man, Severian. You come to the Underworld to visit a monster, and instead of fear or judgment, you offer... kinship?"

"I offer recognition. I have been where you are. Not in this specific place, not in these specific chains, but in the prison that forms when you do something terrible for reasons you believe are right, and then must live with the consequences while the world misunderstands both the action and the reason."

"And did you find a way out of that prison?"

I thought about it. I thought about the crew I had joined, the captain I served, the slow process of becoming something other than what the guild had made me.

"Not out," I said. "Not entirely. But... through? I found people who did not need me to be innocent. Who did not require me to be blameless in order to be valued. Who understood that the question is not whether you have done terrible things, but whether you are still capable of doing good ones."

"That sounds like a kind of salvation."

"Perhaps. Or perhaps it is simply what happens when you stop trying to be forgiven and start trying to be *useful*." I gestured at the garden around us, at the flowers he had coaxed from stone, at the small ecosystem he had created in the depths of his imprisonment. "You have been useful here. You have made something beautiful in a place of darkness."

"The garden is the only thing that keeps me sane."

"Then it has served its purpose. Beauty that preserves sanity is not a small thing. It is, perhaps, the only thing that matters."

---

We talked for hours more. I will not record all of it—some things were too personal to share, some things I am not certain I remember accurately, some things belong to the silence of the Underworld and should not be brought into the light.

But I will record this:

When Luffy finally woke—stretching, yawning, complaining about hunger as though he had not slept through one of the most significant conversations of my life—he walked over to Loki and looked up at the giant's bound face with an expression I had seen before.

It was the expression he had worn when he first saw Robin, wanted and hunted and convinced she had no right to live.

It was the expression he had worn when he learned of Nami's burden, her village's enslavement, the weight she had carried alone for so long.

It was the expression of someone who saw not a monster, not a criminal, not a cautionary tale, but a *person*—a person who had suffered, who had endured, who deserved better than the story the world told about them.

"Hey," Luffy said. "When we leave Elbaf, do you want to come with us?"

Loki's entire body went still.

"What?"

"You've been stuck down here for six years, right? That's boring. And you smell like flowers, which is weird for a monster." Luffy grinned—that grin that held everything, that refused nothing. "I think you'd like the sea. And my ship needs a gardener. Usopp keeps killing the plants."

"I... I am chained. I cannot leave. I am the Shame of Elbaf, the—"

"So? Shanks put those chains on you. And Shanks is my friend. Sort of. It's complicated." Luffy tilted his head. "But you didn't do the stuff they say you did, right? Or you did, but it's not what it looks like?"

Loki's laugh this time was something between a sob and a shout.

"How do you—how could you possibly—"

"I can tell. People who are really bad don't make gardens. They just break things." Luffy nodded, satisfied with his own logic. "So when I talk to Shanks, I'll tell him he made a mistake. And then you can come with us."

"It's not that simple."

"Why not?"

And Loki, the Accursed Prince, the monster of the Underworld, the son who had killed his father at his father's own request and then let the world believe the worst of him for fourteen years—

Loki did not have an answer.

---

We ascended from the Underworld as the sun was setting over Elbaf.

The light struck my eyes like a physical blow after the hours of darkness below. The colors of the world above seemed too vivid, too saturated, as though reality itself had been adjusted to a higher intensity. The giants we passed looked at us with curiosity and suspicion—what business did the Sun God and his strange companion have in the realm of the dead? What had they discussed with the prisoner?

I did not enlighten them. Some conversations are not meant to be shared.

But as we walked back toward the ship, Luffy spoke without looking at me:

"You and him are kind of the same."

"In some ways."

"You both did bad stuff because you thought you had to. And then you felt bad about it. And then you kept going anyway." He kicked a stone; it bounced down the path ahead of us. "That's hard. Most people stop at the feeling-bad part. They just feel bad forever and don't do anything else."

"And you? Have you ever felt that way?"

He was quiet for a moment—longer than I expected, longer than his usual pause between thought and speech.

"At Marineford," he said finally. "When Ace died. I felt bad. *Really* bad. Like everything was broken and I couldn't fix it and there was no point in anything."

"What changed?"

"I remembered I had friends. And that they were waiting for me. And that feeling bad wasn't going to help them, so I had to stop feeling bad and start getting stronger instead." He looked at me, and his eyes—usually so uncomplicated, so direct—held something older. "Is that what you did?"

"I... don't know. I think I am still learning how to do it."

"That's okay." He grinned again, and the weight lifted, and he was once more simply Luffy—the captain, the dreamer, the boy who would be king. "You've got time. We all do. Until we don't. And then it doesn't matter anyway."

---

I returned to the Sunny that night with thoughts I could not organize, feelings I could not name.

I sat at the rail and watched the stars—different stars than Urth had known, arranged in different patterns, telling different stories to those who knew how to read them—and I thought about fathers and sons, about mercy and murder, about the lies we tell to protect the people we love and the truths we bury in the process.

I thought about Thecla, and the knife I had given her, and the question I had never asked: *Do you want to live?*

I thought about Loki, chained in darkness, choosing to garden rather than despair.

I thought about Luffy, who saw a monster and invited him to sail on a pirate ship, as though that were the most natural thing in the world.

And I wrote in my journal—the journal the sea still tries to edit, the journal where some names come easy and others resist the pen—I wrote:

*There are many kinds of prison. The chains that bind Loki are visible, tangible, forged from metal and will. But the chains that bound me were made of other materials: of duty, of training, of the certainty that I knew what mercy meant and that my understanding was correct.*

*Luffy does not understand mercy the way I was taught to understand it. He does not offer the condemned a clean death or the suffering a swift release. He offers something more dangerous: the possibility that the story is not over. The insistence that the person he sees has more chapters yet to live.*

*I do not know if this is wisdom or foolishness. I do not know if Loki will join us, or if the chains that bind him will prove stronger than any rubber-man's optimism. I do not know if the World Government will permit us to reach the end of our journey, or if the shadows on the Empty Throne will reach out and rewrite us all before we find the One Piece.*

*But I know this: I am glad I descended into the Underworld. I am glad I spoke with the Accursed Prince and found, in his garden of impossible flowers, a mirror for my own condition.*

*And I am glad—more glad than I can easily express—that my captain looks at monsters and sees crew.*

*Perhaps that is the theology I have been seeking. Not an Increate beyond the cosmos, not a will beneath all wills, but simply this: the capacity to look at what the world has condemned and see, instead, what it might yet become.*

*The garden grows in darkness.*

*So, perhaps, do I.*

---

*Postscript:*

I learned later that Luffy did speak to Shanks. The conversation, by all accounts, was brief and confusing to everyone who overheard it. Luffy said something about flowers and mistakes and how people who garden aren't really monsters. Shanks laughed, and then went quiet, and then laughed again in a different way.

The chains were not removed. Not that day. Not immediately.

But something changed. I could feel it in the way the giants spoke of their prince afterward—not with fear, exactly, but with something more complicated. Doubt, perhaps. Or the beginning of doubt, which is often more significant than doubt itself.

The story was shifting. The narrative that had held for fourteen years was developing cracks, and through those cracks, light was beginning to seep.

I do not know what will grow from that light.

But I have learned to trust gardens, even impossible ones.

Especially impossible ones.
