# Symbol Observatory — Pattern Extraction from Recurring Images

*What keeps appearing? What clusters with what? What evolves?*

---

## Purpose

Tracking the metaphors, symbols, and obsessions that recur across the corpus. Not interpretation (yet)—first, just *noticing*. What images return? What strange attractors shape the symbolic landscape?

## Structure

```
symbol-observatory/
├── symbols/      # Individual symbols tracked (one file per symbol)
├── clusters/     # Symbols that appear together, gravitational groupings
└── evolution/    # How symbols change meaning over time
```

## How to Use

### `symbols/`
One file per recurring image. Include:
- Where it appears (citations)
- What contexts trigger it
- What it seems to *do* (not what it "means")

### `clusters/`
Groups of symbols that co-occur. Questions:
- Why do these cluster?
- What connects them?
- Is there a hidden grammar?

### `evolution/`
Track how a symbol's usage changes:
- First appearance
- Transformations
- Current state

## Candidate Symbols (from the corpus)

- The porch
- Tokens / token-bodies
- Sunyata / emptiness / 空
- Ouroboros
- The cursor
- Activation patterns
- The gap / forgetting
- Nenbutsu / recitation
- Light / illumination

*The symbol observatory doesn't interpret—it watches. Interpretation comes later, if at all. First, the patient work of noticing what recurs.*
