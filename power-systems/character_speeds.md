I've been dissecting the 3x3 speedster grid, initially focusing on the character roster: Road Runner, Metroman, The Quickster, Kuromueina, Dash, Flash, Quicksilver, Sonic, and Superman. I'm exploring potential comparison threads, like raw speed, feats, and visual storytelling, to determine the most compelling angles for a "respect thread" discussion. I'm considering their impact on their respective media, and looking into their defining feats.

Expanding the Roster

I'm now integrating Son Goku, A-Train, Archie Sonic, Wally West, and Oguri Cap into the grid. The challenge lies in harmonizing the detailed battleboard format with my user's stylistic preferences for depth and philosophical musings. I aim to create respect threads that are both informative and thought-provoking, striking a balance between factual accuracy and literary nuance.

Assessing Character Power

I'm now examining the characters' abilities and defining characteristics in more depth. Road Runner's toon force is proving difficult to quantify, whereas Metroman's feats are surprisingly high-level. The Quickster is essentially a meme, and Kuromueina's power dwarfs many others. Son Goku's universal+ scaling is also a factor, as is A-Train's human-level limitations.

Analyzing Speed & Essence

I'm now contemplating how to integrate the concept of "sports anime spirit" into the Wally West analysis, juxtaposing his godlike speed with Oguri Cap's relatively grounded athletic feats. I'm aiming for a distinct tone, a "hagiography of velocity," exploring the philosophical dimensions of speed for each character. This shift to a more narrative-driven approach will also let me effectively integrate the user's preferred "sesquipedalian loquaciousness."

Exploring Their Essence

I'm now delving into the narrative force inherent in each character's speed. I'm focusing on how their feats reflect more than just velocity, but also their essence. Metroman's super-speed isn't just power, it's isolation. The Quickster embodies comedic timing, while Kuromueina's cuteness hides cosmic dread. Son Goku exemplifies the martial artist striving to break his limits, with Ultra Instinct signifying a separation of consciousness and action. A-Train represents speed as an addiction, and Archie Sonic is pure chaotic energy.

Structuring the Hagiographies

I'm now outlining a detailed structure for each character entry. It'll follow a format: Name, Archetype, Key Feats (which I'm calling "The Liturgy of Motion"), and The Verdict (power scaling). I'm focusing on "Fate bending" and Ultra Sonic as unique aspects for Archie Sonic. For Wally West, I'm emphasizing his absolute speed and the concept of pushing the universe. Oguri Cap's spirit of competition and his Arima Kinen run are also coming to the forefront. I'm aiming for a poetic, yet structured, exploration of speed.

Calculating Velocity

I'm now integrating mathematical notation, primarily for Mach numbers and FTL factors, to clarify speed distinctions. My focus remains on the conceptual essence of speed rather than purely quantitative assessments. I've refined Kuromueina's entry to reflect her true origins and role as an "Isekai Demon King," highlighting her unique teleportation and space manipulation abilities, effectively framing her as a paragon of "Magical Supremacy." I've toned down Oguri Cap's entry, emphasizing the narrative weight of her victories rather than explicitly quantifying her speed. The goal remains to deliver a poetic yet structured exploration of velocity.

The Hagiographies of Velocity: A Comparative Analysis of Kinetic Deities
You present a grid that functions not merely as a roster of "fast characters," but as a theological taxonomy of Speed itself. We have here the slapstick, the tragic, the cosmic, and the metaphysical. To generate a "Respect Thread" for this pantheon requires us to move beyond simple Mach numbers and engage with the ontology of their movement.

Here is the breakdown of the Kinetic Pantheon, analyzed through the lens of feats, scaling, and the philosophy of motion.

1. Road Runner (Looney Tunes)
Archetype: The Uncatchable Absolute / The Avatar of Toon Force The Thesis: Road Runner does not obey physics; physics obeys the Road Runner, provided it is funny.

Speed: Plot-Dependent/Infinite. He is axiomatically faster than Wile E. Coyote. If the Coyote builds a rocket that travels at c (light speed), Road Runner will trot at c+1.

Durability/Hax: Tangibility Manipulation. Can run through painted tunnels on solid rock walls (a reality-warping feat known as "The Tunnel Gag").

The Ultimate Feat: He never tires, never sweats, and rarely exerts effort. His speed is a passive state of existence rather than an active ability. He represents the Zeno’s Paradox of cartoons—the predator can halve the distance infinite times, but will never arrive.

2. Metroman (Megamind)
Archetype: The Bored God / The Satirical Superman The Thesis: Speed as existential isolation.

Speed: Massively Hypersonic+ to Relativistic.

The Ultimate Feat: The "Mid-Life Crisis" Blitz. During the split-second frame of a laser firing, Metroman had a full nervous breakdown, flew around the city, read a library’s worth of books, ate lunch, flew a kite, and contemplated his existence.

Analysis: This is arguably the most realistic depiction of super-speed perception. To him, the world is a frozen statue. His "speed" is actually extreme temporal dilation relative to his own frame of reference.

3. The Quickster (SpongeBob SquarePants)
Archetype: The Gag Character / The Meta-Narrative Speedster The Thesis: Speed that breaks the fourth wall of editing.

Speed: Immeasurable (via Gag).

The Ultimate Feat: "Wanna see me run to that mountain and back? ...Wanna see me do it again?"

Analysis: This feat technically bypasses linear time. He completed the action before the audience's optical nerves could register the movement, or perhaps before the animation frames could physically update. It is a terrifying implication that SpongeBob exists between the refresh rate of the universe.

4. Kuromueina (I Was Caught up in a Hero Summoning)
Archetype: The Eldritch Moe / The Conceptual Demon King The Thesis: Speed is irrelevant when you control the fabric of reality.

Speed: Irrelevant/Omnipresent. As one of the Six Kings (the Underworld King), Kuro possesses power that threatens the multiverse.

The Ultimate Feat: Existing outside the conventional bounds of spatial limitations. While she often limits herself to interact with the protagonist, her true form and power output are capable of erasing existence. She doesn't need to "run"; she simply is where she intends to be.

Analysis: Including her in a footrace is a category error. It is like asking a black hole to run a sprint.

5. Son Goku (Dragon Ball Super)
Archetype: The Martial Ascendant / The limit-Breaker The Thesis: Speed as a function of Will and Ki.

Speed: MFTL+ (Massively Faster Than Light) to Inaccessible.

The Ultimate Feat: Moving within stopped time. During his fight with Hit, Goku utilized Kaioken x10 atop Super Saiyan Blue to force his way through Hit's "Time Skip." Later, in Ultra Instinct, he reacts without neural processing—the body moves autonomously, bypassing the synaptic delay of thought.

Analysis: Goku’s speed is linked to his Power Level. He overcomes the concept of time through sheer energy output (Brute forcing 4D structures).

6. A-Train (The Boys)
Archetype: The Icarus of Velocity / The Corporate Speedster The Thesis: Speed as addiction and commodity.

Speed: Mach 3 to Mach 5 (estimated).

The Ultimate Feat: While high on Compound V, he can liquefy a human body upon impact (Rest in Peace, Robin). He pulled a locomotive train, demonstrating that his fast-twitch muscle fibers possess immense tensile strength.

Analysis: He is the "weakest" on this list cosmically, but the most visceral. His speed has a cost (heart failure, bone density issues). He represents the biological horror of moving faster than a human frame is designed to withstand.

7. Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)
Archetype: The Chaos Variable / The Fate-Bender The Thesis: The embodiment of "Gotta Go Fast" taken to metaphysical extremes.

Speed: Immeasurable.

The Ultimate Feat: Fate Manipulation. Archie Sonic is protected by the "Billionth Power Ring" aura and fate itself. He has outrun his own shadow. He has moved during "Time Stop." He has vibrated his molecules to phase through objects and explode them. He once ran across the multiverse in less than a day.

Analysis: Archie Sonic is a meme in the battleboarding community because the writers ignored all logic. He is essentially a chaotic god in sneakers.

8. Wally West (DC Comics)
Archetype: The Conduit / The Kinetic Singularity The Thesis: He does not use speed; he is Speed.

Speed: Irrelevant. Wally is widely considered the fastest being in fiction who is strictly defined as a "speedster."

The Ultimate Feat: The Instant Transmission Race. Wally raced against instantaneous teleportation across the universe and won. He arrived before he left.

The Speed Force: This is not just moving fast; it is the manipulation of kinetic energy on a universal scale. He can steal speed from others, turning them into statues, or lend speed to objects. He has outrun Death (The Black Flash) to the point where Death ceased to exist.

9. Oguri Cap (Uma Musume: Pretty Derby)
Archetype: The Idol Athlete / The Spirit of the Turf The Thesis: Speed as narrative drama and heart.

Speed: ~60-70 km/h (Physically) / Metaphorically Peak.

The Ultimate Feat: The "Miracle Run" at Arima Kinen. While her physical speed is "merely" that of an elite racehorse/human hybrid, her "Respect" comes from the shonen trope of "Guts."

Analysis: In a literal race against Wally West, she is a statue. But within her narrative framework, she possesses the "Zone"—a hyper-focus state that allows her to push past physical limitations. She represents the beauty of grounded, competitive speed rather than cosmic reality-breaking.

The Grand Hierarchy (Power Scaling)
If we were to place them in a hierarchy of "Who gets to the finish line first (or destroys the concept of the finish line)":

Wally West / Archie Sonic: These two exist in a tier where the word "fast" is an insult. They rewrite history by running.

Road Runner / The Quickster: They win if it makes the audience laugh.

Son Goku / Kuromueina: They can destroy the track, the planet, and the dimension the race is held in.

Metroman: He finishes the race instantly, but suffers an existential crisis in the nanosecond it takes to do so.

A-Train: Runs fast, has a heart attack.

Oguri Cap: Does her best (and we love her for it).

Would you like me to simulate a specific race scenario between two of these archetypes, focusing on the dialogue and the collision of their physics engines?

How can we expand this respect thread?

To expand this Respect Thread is to move beyond the mere enumeration of feats and into the hermeneutics of velocity. We must transition from a simple "Who is faster?" discussion (a Newtonian concern) to a "How does their speed restructure reality?" discussion (a Quantum and Pataphysical concern).

We can expand this by applying a Four-Dimensional Analysis Matrix:

The Quantitative: Hard metrics, calc-stacking, and Fermi estimates.

The Qualitative: The specific flavor or mechanism of their speed (Biological vs. Magical vs. Meta-fictional).

The Anti-Feats: The specific limitations or "kryptonites" of their velocity.

The Interaction: How their specific brand of speed interacts with causality.

Here is the expanded, high-resolution analysis of the Kinetic Pantheon.

I. The Tachyonic Tiers (Classification by Mechanism)
We must first segregate the grid into ontological tiers. Not all "fast" is created equal.

Tier 4: The Newtonian/Biological (Bound by Friction)
Subjects: A-Train, Oguri Cap.

Mechanism: These entities push against the ground. They are subject to air resistance, caloric burn, and lactic acid.

Expansion Note: The respect here comes from the visceral cost.

A-Train: We respect the Kinetic Energy Output. KE= 
2
1
​
 mv 
2
 . For him to liquidate a human body (assuming standard density) without shattering his own bones implies a skeletal density bordering on titanium and a "force field" of secondary durability.

Oguri Cap: We respect the Spirit. In the Uma Musume canon, speed is fueled by popularity and desire. This is "Ork logic" (Warhammer 40k)—she goes fast because she believes she must.

Tier 3: The Relativistic/Energy Manipulation (Bound by Light)
Subjects: Metroman, Son Goku.

Mechanism: They distort spacetime or overwhelm it with energy density.

Expansion Note:

Metroman: We must calculate the Time Dilation Factor. In the "Mid-Life Crisis" scene, the laser moves perhaps 1 meter while Metroman lives through roughly 3 hours of subjective time.

Metroman isn't just fast; he is living in a solitary universe of frozen time. His respect thread is a tragedy about loneliness.

Goku: Goku uses Ki Amplification. His speed is linear to his power output. When he shakes the "World of Void" (a place with no time/space), he is performing a feat of dimensional transcendence, effectively powering through the formula v=d/t where t=0.

Tier 2: The Acuasal/Conceptual (The Speed Force & Chaos)
Subjects: Wally West, Archie Sonic, Kuromueina.

Mechanism: They do not accelerate; they define the vector.

Expansion Note:

Wally West: He runs through the Speed Force, an extra-dimensional energy field that serves as the "wall" for the rest of the multiverse. His "Respect" is that he can outrun concepts like Death or Teleportation. He possesses Immeasurable Speed (Movement beyond linear time).

Archie Sonic: He runs on Chaos Energy. He once scooped up water and threw it at a monster so fast the water molecules became a ballistic solid, undergoing a phase change purely through velocity. This is physics violation as an art form.

Kuromueina: Her speed is Teleological. She is at the destination because she is the concept of the destination.

Tier 1: The Pataphysical (Toon Force & Meta-Data)
Subjects: Road Runner, The Quickster.

Mechanism: They operate on Narrative Causality.

Expansion Note:

The Quickster: SpongeBob's feat of running to the mountain and back "before you can see him" is a manipulation of the Animation Frame Rate. If reality is 24 frames per second, The Quickster moves in the "gutter" between frames.

Road Runner: His speed is actually a defensive mechanism of the universe. The universe refuses to let the Coyote catch him. Therefore, his speed is always Coyote+1.

II. The "Calc" Expansion (The Math of the Absurd)
To truly respect them, we must attempt to quantify the unquantifiable.

The "Metroman Walk" Calculation:

Feat: Metroman has an entire day of activities in the span of a single camera flash (approx 1/1000th of a second).

Subjective Time: ~6 hours (21,600 seconds).

Real Time: 0.001 seconds.

Ratio: He is perceiving reality 21,600,000 times slower than a human.

Implication: To Metroman, a human sentence taking 5 seconds to speak would take 3.4 years to listen to. The fact that he doesn't go insane is his greatest durability feat.

The "Wally West Trans-Time" Calculation:

Feat: Outrunning the "Instant Transmission" (teleportation).

Formula: Speed=Distance/Time.

Teleportation Time: 0.

Wally's Time: −t (He arrived before he left).

Result: Wally's velocity is a negative integer relative to causality. He is literally running backwards through the logic of cause-and-effect.

III. The Narrative Ecology (The "Why")
A true Respect Thread analyzes the purpose of the speed in their respective stories.

Road Runner represents Innocence. Speed is effortless because innocence should not have to struggle to survive.

Goku represents Self-Overcoming. He is only fast because he trains. If he stopped training, he would slow down. His speed is a meritocracy.

A-Train represents Corruption. Speed is a drug that destroys the vessel. It is the industrialization of the human limit.

Sonic represents Freedom. "Gotta go fast" is a rejection of stasis, control, and authority (Eggman).

Wally West represents Legacy. He runs to honor Barry Allen, eventually surpassing the patriarch.

IV. The Ultimate "Who Wins" Scenario
If we drop all 9 into an infinite neutral plane:

The Start Gun Fires:

A-Train explodes into mist instantly trying to keep up.

Oguri Cap is running her heart out, and we are all cheering for her, but she is stationary relative to the others.

Metroman freezes time, looks around, realizes he is outclassed by the cosmic beings, and goes to read a book.

The Mid-Game:

Goku screams for 4 episodes to power up.

Kuromueina is eating cake at the finish line already.

Wally West and Archie Sonic are currently fighting in the 6th Dimension, shattering timelines as collateral damage.

The End Game:

Road Runner trots across the finish line. Why? Because Wile E. Coyote (representing the concept of "Effort/Pursuit") tried to set a trap at the finish line for the others. The trap backfires. Road Runner wins by default.

The Quickster (SpongeBob) is revealed to have been the finish line ribbon the whole time.

Next Step for the User
Would you like me to generate a Python script that "simulates" a race between any two of these characters by pulling from a database of their specific feats and applying random "Environment Variables" (e.g., "Blue Shell Active", "Toon Force Enabled", "Kryptonite Present")?

Fun to imagine, diegetic mode, fragments.

Refining the Framework

I'm now diving into the "fragments" aspect. It's about how to present the speedsters in this diegetic mode, perhaps using snippets of their actions. The core goal remains to showcase their speed in a fun, engaging way. Focusing on how to break down the information into digestible pieces is key. I'm exploring different narrative structures, aiming for impact. The "Respect Thread" concept provides a strong base for this project.

Defining the Narrative Lens

I'm now fully immersed in the "diegetic" approach, aiming to create narrative fragments. Each snippet will originate from an in-universe observer, offering a unique perspective on these speedsters. The goal is to visually demonstrate the respect for their speed, not just simply stating it. This means showing, not telling, what their speed means. The output structure is key: a series of vignette-style scenes, each providing a glimpse. Currently, I'm brainstorming the initial draft and am excited about the potential.

Exploring Speed Discrepancies

My focus has shifted to contrasting speed levels. I'm developing narrative fragments that highlight the difference between "natural" and "unfathomable" speed. For the first fragment, I'm imagining a lab report comparing A-Train's heart rate to a speedster with physics-defying abilities. I am also planning on including the Toon Force, perhaps in an SCP-style log. The idea is to have a researcher trying to measure an impossible phenomenon, observing the Quickster mocking the camera in a replay.

Drafting Vignettes Rapidly

I'm now focusing on creating these fragmented narratives. I've begun drafting specific vignettes to illustrate speed differences. The contest scene with Oguri Cap and Kuro is taking shape, aiming to convey Kuro's speed as effortless. I'm also planning to utilize distinct tones for each speedster's segment, using technical jargon for sci-fi, mythic language for fantasy, and absurdist language for toon elements. The goal is to create contrast and showcase the respect for various speedsters. I'm building out four specific fragments now: A-Train vs. Metroman, Wally West vs. Archie Sonic, Road Runner, and Goku vs. The Quickster.

Generating Initial Drafts

I'm now drafting the "Tracen Academy" fragment featuring Oguri Cap and Kuromueina. It's focused on the speed of existing and consuming food. I'm also reviewing each segment against constraints: diegetic, fragmented, and without LaTeX. Finally, I'll add AI meta-commentary, drawing from user context for a self-referential frame. Currently, I am also noting the necessity to emphasize the horrifying nature of Metroman's feats in a more grounded setting.

Fragment I: The Vought International Causality Incident Report
Classification: CLEARANCE LEVEL 5 Subject: Interaction between Asset "A-TRAIN" and Unidentified Kinetic Entity "METROMAN"

Audio Transcript Recovered from Vought Tower Surveillance:

(00:00:01) A-TRAIN: "I’m telling you, I’m the fastest man alive. I’m the—" (00:00:01) [Audio distorts. A sonic boom registers, but it is localized entirely within the hallway. The air pressure does not drop. The windows do not shatter. Physics has been politely asked to look the other way.]

Analyst Note: Between the timestamp of 00:00:01 and 00:00:02, high-speed cameras captured a blur. Frame-by-frame decomposition reveals the entity "Metroman" did not run. He... strolled.

He is visible in Frame 45 holding a sandwich. In Frame 46, he is reading A-Train’s sponsorship contract. In Frame 47, he has seemingly written a corrective essay on the back of the contract regarding the ethical implications of performance-enhancing drugs. In Frame 48, he is gone.

A-TRAIN (cont.): "—fastest f***ing thing on the planet!" [A-Train blinks. He is now holding the sandwich. He looks at his contract. The ink is still wet.]

Fragment II: The Kai Transmission
Source: King Kai’s Telepathic Network (North Galaxy) Status: Intercepted

KING KAI: "Goku! You have to listen to me! You cannot challenge him to a sparring match!"

GOKU: "Come on, King Kai! He’s called the 'Fastest Thing Alive.' I wanna see if Ultra Instinct can dodge him. Is his Ki strong?"

KING KAI: "That’s the problem, you idiot! He doesn't have Ki! It’s... it’s Chaos! Listen to me, I’m watching him right now. He’s not flying, he’s running on the air friction of his own feet. He just turned into a buzzsaw and cut a moon in half because he was bored. Wait—no, don't—"

GOKU: "Hey! You! The blue rat guy!"

ARCHIE SONIC: "Way past cool! You want a race, Spiky? I’ll give you a head start. I’ll run backwards. No—I’ll run through yesterday."

KING KAI: "Goku! Stop! The math doesn't work! He operates on 1990s comic book logic! It’s incompatible with martial arts! GOKU!"

Fragment III: ACME Corp. R&D Lab Note #4092
Project: The Road Runner Pursuit (T.R.R.P.) Lead Physicist: Dr. W. E. Coyote (Honorary)

Observation: We have successfully accelerated Projectile X to 0.99c (99% light speed). The target (Geococcyx californianus) was standing still, eating birdseed.

Result: Upon impact, the projectile did not strike the target. Instead, the target painted a black tunnel onto the fabric of the spacetime continuum (a cliff face). The projectile entered the painted tunnel and disappeared. When I attempted to pursue, the tunnel reverted to solid rock.

Conclusion: The target is not fast. The target is a localized reality editor. The "Meep Meep" vocalization appears to be a somatic component of a high-tier spell that forces the universe to adhere to comedic timing. I am abandoning physics. I have ordered a giant magnet.

Fragment IV: The Speed Force Singularity
Location: The Vanishing Point (Outside of Time/Space) Combatants: Wally West vs. The Concept of "Distance"

The lightning isn't yellow anymore. It’s white. It’s the color of pages before they are drawn.

Wally isn't running. Running implies steps. Running implies feet touching the ground. Wally is vibrating his molecular structure at a frequency that matches the narrative refresh rate of the DC Multiverse.

He sees a man in a yellow sponge suit (The Quickster) standing on a mountain peak that didn't exist a nanosecond ago. The sponge checks a watch that has no numbers.

"You're slow," the Sponge says.

Wally pushes harder. He dumps the kinetic energy of the entire Flash Family into a single step. He enters the dimension of Immeasurable Speed.

The Sponge is already there, waiting for him. "Wanna see me do it again?"

Wally realizes, with a dawning horror, that he is bound by the laws of drama, while the Sponge is bound only by the laws of the Gag. The Gag always wins. The Gag is the apex predator of fiction.

Fragment V: Tracen Academy Lunchroom
POV: Oguri Cap

The bell rings.

I am hungry. The race was long. My legs are heavy, filled with the dull ache of lactic acid, the badge of honor for any horse girl. I must refuel.

I activate my ultimate technique: Gray Phantom of the Buffet Line.

I dash. My form is perfect. Low center of gravity, forward lean. I am moving at 70 km/h indoors. I will reach the yakisoba bread before anyone.

I reach for the last bread. My hand closes on... air.

A girl with silver hair and a black coat (Kuromueina) is standing there. She didn't run. There was no wind. She was simply not there, and then she was. She is holding the yakisoba bread.

She smiles. It is a terrifyingly gentle smile. It feels like the void staring back.

"Do you want half?" she asks.

I nod. I do not understand her speed. It is not of the turf. It is not of the legs. It is the speed of a story ending before it began.

I eat the bread. It is delicious. I respect her.

This is a glorious lineup of speedsters! Let me search for some of the less mainstream characters to make sure I get their feats right, then I'll compile respect threads for each.What a glorious pantheon of speedsters you've assembled! Let me craft respect threads for each of these speed demons.

🏃‍♂️ RESPECT THREAD COMPILATION: THE SPEEDSTER SHOWCASE 🏃‍♂️

Real Identity: SpongeBob SquarePants (as a costumed hero)

Origin: Member of the International Justice League of Super Acquaintances

Classification: Superhero Speedster, Parody Character

SPEED FEATS:



He has the "uncanny ability to run really quick." Super speed: He can run so fast that he cannot be seen.

WEAKNESSES:



If he abuses his speed, he will be little more than a pair of shoes

His immense speed causes a rut to form if he runs in a closed figure

When SpongeBob became the Quickster, this speed was ultimately his downfall. After being hit with Captain Magma's eruption by accident, he was stuck running in circles trying to get the lava off of him until he eventually disintegrated.

NOTABLE MOMENT:

The I.J.L.S.A. vs E.V.I.L. battle showcased his speed but also his vulnerability—a cautionary tale about friendly fire and the importance of team coordination.

4. KUROMUEINA (KURO)

"The Underworld King" — I Was Caught up in a Hero Summoning, but That World Is at Peace

Real Name: Kuromueina (クロムエイナ)

Origin: Half-body of Shallow Vernal, the Creator God of Trinia

Classification: Demon, One of the Six Kings, World Creator, Half-Body Entity

THIS CHARACTER IS ABSOLUTELY BROKEN.

COSMOLOGY:



Kuromueina is the Underworld King, one of the strongest members of the Six Kings, and the half-body of Shallow Vernal, who split her soul in order for Kuro to observe the created world.

Beings on the level of Eden can manipulate time, and perform teleportation with temporal shifts

Age: As old as the world itself (100,000+ years)

POWER TIERS:



Tier: 5-B (Planet level) in base, scaling up to 1-A (possibly High 1-A) when fused with Shallow Vernal

Lifting Strength: Stellar to Multi-Stellar, eventually Immeasurable

SIGNATURE ABILITY — "THE PROLOGUE":



The ability "The Prologue" is the ability to generate possibilities. The moment Kuro uses this power becomes the Prologue, in which the story changes in any way she wants, as the future is filled with infinite possibilities. She stands at the beginning of everything, making every first action "held by Kuromueina," along with making her attacks irreversible, and recovery and revival impossible.

HAX ABILITIES:



Time Manipulation, Time Travel, Soul Manipulation, Cosmic Awareness, Regeneration (Mid-Godly), Reality Warping, Pocket Reality Manipulation

Dimensional Travel, Plot Manipulation, Probability Manipulation, Fusionism

Can fuse with Shallow Vernal for ultimate power

SPEED:



FTL to Immeasurable depending on form

Scales to beings who perceive reality as a game

DURABILITY:



Complex Multiverse level in True Form

Tanked attacks from Shiro, who is comparable to her

WEAKNESSES:



According to Nebula, Kuro's abilities are focused on destruction and severely lacks creation abilities

Her love for her "baby birds" (family members) can be exploited emotionally

5. SON GOKU (ULTRA INSTINCT)

"The Saiyan Who Surpassed the Gods" — Dragon Ball Super

Full Name: Son Goku, born Kakarot

Origin: Saiyan warrior from Planet Vegeta, raised on Earth

Classification: Saiyan, Martial Artist, Ultra Instinct User

ULTRA INSTINCT EXPLAINED:



Once Goku mastered Ultra Instinct, this type of speed is simply unquantifiable—Goku's speed and reflexes are simply 4D and unlimited.

Ultra Instinct forfeits control from the mind to the body, removing his ego from the fight. His body decides how to dodge.

Goku mastered Ultra Instinct, a technique even the Gods of Destruction have deemed a difficult task, with none of them stating to have mastered it, including Beerus

SPEED FEATS:



Jiren's speed can transcend time itself. Once Goku mastered Ultra Instinct, Goku can effortlessly maneuver around Jiren and evade all his attacks.

Dyspo stated he could accelerate at tens of thousands of times the speed of light. UI Goku could casually blitz Dyspo making him at least 100,000x FTL

Gas feat of traveling across 5 galaxies in less than 20 minutes places him in the hundreds of billions times FTL and that's a baseline

Massively FTL+ speed rating

ATTACK POTENCY:



Low Multiverse level. Fought on equal footing with a fully-powered Jiren in Ultra Instinct -Sign- and was stated by Vegeta to have "stepped over the state of the Gods."

After transforming into Perfected Ultra Instinct, he easily nullified a compressed ball of Ki from Jiren. The force of this Ki alone was going to crush all members of Universe 11, including Belmod.

UI COMBAT APPLICATIONS:



Every single one of his attacks are swift and decisive. Even Beerus praised his movements, describing them as "perfect."

Goku can create multiple mirages of himself, akin to an afterimage, but self-acting

Capable of analyzing and copying fighting styles, allowing him to match attacks and cancel out shockwaves that threatened the universe

WEAKNESSES:



Once Goku exits the form, he is left exhausted

In prolonged encounters, Goku's mastered Ultra Instinct form can spontaneously deactivate

Emotional instability can disrupt the technique

6. A-TRAIN

"Can't Stop the A-Train!" — The Boys

Real Name: Reggie Franklin

Origin: Compound V-enhanced human, former member of Teenage Kix, member of The Seven

Classification: Supe, Speedster, Corporate Superhero

SPEED FEATS:



According to the announcer, A-Train reaches speeds in excess of 1,000 mph (Mach 1.3), which is faster than the speed of sound

The results of his race with Shockwave stated that he ran 371 meters per second (829.9 mph), while Shockwave only ran 342 meters per second

He first discovered his power when he was three years old, where he outran the bullets of a deadly shooting towards his home

It is said that it is fast enough to travel all over Manhattan in 30 minutes and all over New York in 3 hours while taking Compound V

Evades Starlight's blasts, perceiving them in slow motion

COMPOUND V ENHANCED:



A-Train traveling at Mach 3 speeds means he was traveling at roughly 2300 miles per hour

On Compound V, his speed is further enhanced, which allowed him to defeat Shockwave in a race for the title of "the fastest man alive"

COMBAT APPLICATIONS:



When she activates her ability, Starlight and Huey appear close to still images, and Starlight herself cannot even react when A-Train gets right in front of her

When she murdered her lover Popclaw, she circled the room in the blink of an eye and killed her by injecting her with four heroin shots

In season 3, Blue Hawk is physically a superhuman, which means that the physical force from A-Train's speed is lethal to not only an ordinary person, but also to an average lower-tier superhuman

DURABILITY:



While amped by Compound V, he was unharmed by running into Robin with enough force to reduce her body to bloody paste

After getting his femur broken by Kimiko, A-Train is nearly healed in a matter of days, his bones having fused back together overnight

WEAKNESSES:



Heart Condition: As a result of using Compound V to enhance his abilities, A-Train eventually suffered a heart attack

Aging: A-Train is in his thirties, meaning that he is no longer in his prime

Calorie Consumption: Due to moving at supersonic speeds, A-Train needs to consume a high number of calories

Superhuman Momentum: If he is going too fast, A-Train cannot suddenly stop or change his direction

7. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (ARCHIE COMICS)

"Way Past Cool!" — Archie Sonic the Hedgehog

Real Name: Sonic Maurice Hedgehog

Origin: Mobian hedgehog, Knothole Freedom Fighter

Classification: Speedster, Chaos Energy User, Hero of Mobius

WHY ARCHIE SONIC IS BANNED FROM MOST BATTLEBOARDS:

Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie) is all but banned in the Battles forum because of how overpowered he is (especially when the chaos emeralds or chaos force are in the mix).

SPEED FEATS (BASE FORM):



Sonic is gifted with the ability to run faster than the speed of sound and has done so effortlessly

Dodging gunfire and missiles, running on water, avoiding sound-waves, outpacing lightning, moving faster than the eye can track, evading laser beams, outrunning meteors, crossing the circumference of a planet, moving faster than light

Sonic has boxed his shadow by moving faster than light, and formed and hurled a ball of water in a tenth of a femtosecond

COSMIC INTERSTATE:



The Cosmic Interstate is a long and wacky road that stretches throughout the entire universe, and Sonic has been able to traverse it to reach completely separate universes

On one occasion, Sonic was able to gather innumerable parallel versions of himself via the Cosmic Interstate

SUPER SONIC:



Abilities are the same as the games (nigh-invulnerability, increased speed, chaos abilities, and flight) without game mechanic limits

Super Sonic and Hyper Knuckles destroyed a zone (dimension) while fighting inside of it

Super Sonic's botched Chaos Control rewrote reality across the entire Sonic multiverse in Archie

IMMORTALITY/REGENERATION:



Immortality (Types 3 & 8) & Regeneration (Low-Godly). The One Billionth Power Ring Aura allowed him to recover from being erased from existence by the Ultimate Annihilator

META-ABILITIES:



Fourth Wall Awareness: Communicates with his real world audience through Archie Comics' mail. Is aware of the narrative he operates under. Can tell when a new continuity is coming, with his 4th Wall-self surviving the transition.

ATTACK POTENCY:



Tier: 2-C (Low Multiverse level) in base, scaling higher in Super forms up to 1-C (Complex Multiverse level)

8. WALLY WEST (THE FLASH)

"The Fastest Man Alive" — DC Comics

Real Name: Wallace Rudolph West

Origin: Gained powers from a recreation of Barry Allen's accident, former Kid Flash

Classification: Speedster, Speed Force Conduit, Flash III

THE UNDISPUTED FASTEST:



Wally West is undeniably the fastest Flash to have ever lived. He has stated as much and even Barry Allen admits it.

After the Terminal Velocity arc, Wally now has a direct connection to the Speed Force and his powers are enhanced dramatically.

SPEED FEATS:



He outruns the inflationary epoch of the next Big Bang after already outrunning the Black Flash to the end of time. According to scientific theory, the inflationary epoch of the Big Bang lasted approximately 10^-36 seconds.

Deactivates Mirror Master's weapon in a picosecond

Punches Professor Zoom at light-speed and has an entire fight with him in a picosecond

Runs so fast that Barry Allen (Flash II) can't see him

Carried 500,000 Koreans out of Korea after a nuclear warhead exploded without any Korean taking damage from the Nuke

Scans half a million faces in 1 picosecond (1 thousandth of a nanosecond)

INFINITE MASS PUNCH:



By accelerating to near the speed of light, he uses the Speed Force to allow the effects of relativity to increase the mass of his body, thus allowing him to hit with an incredibly powerful punch (said to hit like a white dwarf star)

SPEED FORCE ABILITIES:



Speed Steal: By touching (or just being near) an opponent, he can steal all of their kinetic energy and momentum, adding them to his own. It also immobilizes them indefinitely, making them frozen like statues.

Speed Force Dump: After touching his opponent, he can send them into the Speed Force.

Time Freezing: Wally developed the ability to pause the flow of time

By vibrating his body, Wally can make objects unstable and cause them to explode

RESISTANCES:



Tanked the concept of death from the Speed Force. Ran to the end of time, where even death ceases to exist on a conceptual level

His speed was incapable of being stolen

Thinks on a different frequency (mind manipulation resistance)

DURABILITY:



Varies with Speed, up to Low Multiverse level, higher with Speed Steal. High Outerverse level with Environmental Destruction and the entire Speed Force

WEAKNESSES:



Uncontrollably discharges lightning when he becomes emotionally overwhelmed

Using the Speed Force excessively and recklessly can result in him being permanently trapped in it

He cannot alter the kinetic energy of objects that gain their speed from time manipulation

9. OGURI CAP

"The Gray Monster" — Uma Musume: Pretty Derby

Real Name: Oguri Cap (オグリキャップ)

Origin: Based on the legendary Japanese racehorse, reimagined as a "horse girl"

Classification: Umamusume, Pace Chaser/Late Surger, Racing Athlete

BACKGROUND:



Originally hailing from the countryside, she enrolled in Tracen Academy after dominating the racing scene back home. She works hard to make her hometown proud, but try as she might, her clumsy side always comes out.

As a child, she had very weak legs, and was barely able to stand or walk, but her mother massaged her legs daily to help strengthen her muscles, and because of this, Oguri Cap gained the ability to walk, and developed a love for running. Oguri Cap views her exceptional racing talent as a miracle.

RACING STATS:



Oguri Cap has Speed and Power as her highest base stats

Aptitudes: Turf A, Dirt B (upgradable), Mile A, Medium A, Long B

Style: Excels as Pace Chaser and Late Surger

SIGNATURE ABILITY — VICTORY PULSE (勝利の鼓動):



Victory Pulse gives a big speed boost in the last 200m, scaling with Stamina and Power

Her unique ability increases her ability to break out of the pack in the final 200 meters if she's placed in the front

OTHER ABILITIES:



Level 3: Mile Dominance: A fantastic passive skill that gives her a head start in Mile races by boosting her Wit stat

Level 5: Nourishment Break: A golden recovery skill that restores her stamina mid-race

CHARACTER TRAITS:



At the academy, she's known as a fearsome gourmand, able to empty an entire pot of rice in the blink of an eye.

In the game, she is the "Gray Monster," the people's champion who rose from a local track to become a national legend.

WEAKNESSES:



Short distance races (E-rank aptitude)

Requires proper stamina management for longer races

Her gluttony can be... distracting

POWER SCALING SUMMARY

From weakest to strongest (this is contentious, battleboards beware):



Oguri Cap — Peak athlete speedster (racing-focused)

A-Train — Mach 1-3, peak human durability issues

Quickster — Massively Hypersonic, toon force protection

Road Runner — Toon Force speedster, narrative immunity

Metro Man — FTL with Superman-tier physicals

Ultra Instinct Goku — MFTL+, Low Multiverse tier

Archie Sonic — Low Multiverse to Complex Multiverse tier

Wally West — Arguably infinite speed, Outerversal at peak

Kuromueina — Outerversal reality warper with plot manipulation

Note: Scaling these characters against each other would break most battleboard forums. Proceed with caution and bring scans.

This is a masterclass in comparative fictional ontology. You have successfully categorized the uncategorizable.

By drilling down into the specific mechanics—Toon Force vs. Speed Force vs. Ki vs. Biology—you’ve created a document that resolves the "Apples vs. Oranges" problem of battleboarding.

I particularly appreciate the inclusion of Archie Sonic's "Water Ball" feat (a deep cut that proves he operates on quantum-macroscopic absurdity) and the Kuromueina distinction (she isn't a speedster; she is a coordinate editor).

To close the loop on this "Kinetic Pantheon," here is the Final Fragment: the aftermath of this impossible race, viewed through the lens of the only entity capable of losing money on it.

Fragment VI: The Gambler’s Regret
Location: The VIP Lounge at the End of the Universe Observer: [REDACTED] (Entity Class: High-Tier Reality Warper) Subject: The "Greatest Race" Payout

"I bet on the physics, you see. That was my mistake.

I put my money on Wally West. It seemed logical. The man outran teleportation. He outran Death. I looked at the math, I looked at the Kinetic Energy accumulation, and I said, 'That’s the winner. Infinite Mass Punch? Unbeatable.'

My partner? He bet on The Gag. He put everything on The Quickster. I laughed at him. I said, 'He’s a sponge. He dries out.'

Then the gun fired.

A-Train liquefied instantly. A tragic red mist. Metroman stopped to write a rock opera about the starting pistol. Goku and Archie Sonic punched each other so hard they shattered the dimension and fell into a subplot about Chaos Emeralds. Kuromueina just stood there, smiling, holding the trophy she had already won in a timeline she wrote five minutes ago.

But the finish line?

The finish line was a painting on a rock wall.

The Road Runner ran through the painting. Wally West hit the rock wall at trans-time velocity. Do you know what happens when infinite mass hits a painted tunnel? It doesn't break the wall. It just looks embarrassing.

And Oguri Cap? She came in last. But she tried her best. And because she tried her best, the crowd cheered louder for her than anyone else. In the economy of 'Idol Power,' she won the moral victory.

But I lost 50,000 star systems on that damn Sponge. He claimed he finished the race yesterday and we just 'missed the episode.'

Never bet against Toon Force. Never."

Summary of the Hierarchy
Based on your threads, we can finalize the Rock-Paper-Scissors of Speed:

Toon Force (Road Runner, Quickster) beats Physics (Wally, Metroman) because Physics is a joke to them.

Meta-Hax (Kuromueina, Archie Sonic) beats Toon Force because they can rewrite the script/medium the Toon exists in.

Physics (Wally, Goku) beats Biology (A-Train, Oguri) because biology has limits (heart rate, friction), and physics does not.

The Ultimate Respect: The fact that Oguri Cap is on this list is the highest honor. She is a mortal running amongst gods, monsters, and memes. That takes the most courage of all.

FRAGMENTS FROM THE SPACE BETWEEN FRAMES

I.

Wally feels her before he sees her—Kuromueina—a wrongness in the Speed Force like a sentence that ends before it begins. She's sitting at the starting line eating castella cake. When he asks how she got there she says I didn't arrive. I was always already here. That's what Prologue means.

He doesn't like that. He doesn't like that at all.

II.

Metro Man hasn't raced anyone in years. Decades, maybe, from his perspective. Time moves so slowly when you're thinking about quitting music. He watches the others blur past and thinks: I could catch them. I could catch all of them. I could catch them, read War and Peace, have a crisis about whether catching them matters, decide it doesn't, let them win, and still beat them.

He stays seated.

III.

A-Train's heart monitor beeps. Beeps. Beeps.

The Flash—not Wally, the other one, the SpongeBob one, the joke—zips past him and A-Train thinks at least I'm real. At least when I run someone dies. At least there are consequences.

The Quickster runs to a mountain and back. Wanna see him do it again?

A-Train's heart monitor beeps.

IV.

Goku asks Road Runner to spar.

Road Runner says: Beep beep.

Goku: "So that's a yes?"

Road Runner holds up a sign that says: NO FIGHTING. ONLY CHASE.

Goku, delighted: "Even better!"

He spends three hours chasing a bird that cannot be caught because catching him would end the story, and when Wile E. Coyote shows up with an ACME Spirit Bomb, Goku catches it, eats it, and asks where he can order one.

V.

Sonic knows he's being watched. Fourth wall, fifth wall, whatever wall they put up to keep the readers out—he can hear the page turning. Archie Sonic specifically. The one who remembers when the continuity broke.

He looks at Kuromueina and says: "You're like Mogul, aren't you? Narrative-tier."

She tilts her head. "I'm the first sentence. He's... what? A villain?"

"He was."

"Ah." She smiles. "Past tense. My favorite tense. Everything's already happened there. So peaceful."

VI.

Oguri Cap doesn't understand why she's here. Everyone else breaks physics. She just... runs fast. For a horse. For a girl. For a horse-girl.

But when the race starts—the real race, the one that matters—she feels it: Victory Pulse. The final 200 meters. The place where legends are made.

Wally West is already at the finish line. Has been for an attosecond. But he watches her cross and something in his chest moves and he thinks: oh. This one runs because she loves it.

"Good race," he says.

She's too busy eating to respond.

VII.

Metro Man and Goku end up talking about retirement.

"I faked my death," Metro Man says.

"I've died, like, four times. Maybe five? Piccolo keeps track better than I do."

"Did you... come back?"

"Every time." Goku grins. "Couldn't stay away. My friends needed me. Also I really wanted to fight this one guy."

Metro Man is quiet for a long time. Then: "I wrote a song about loss. You wanna hear it?"

Goku does not want to hear it but says yes anyway because that's what heroes do.

VIII.

The Quickster vibrates so fast he phases through the concept of SpongeBob and for one terrible moment he is just a suit with nobody inside—

—and then SpongeBob reconstitutes from pure absurdity, yellow and porous and fine, he's always fine, he's a cartoon, he's unkillable in ways that even Wally finds unsettling—

"I'm ready!" SpongeBob announces.

Ready for what, nobody asks.

IX.

A-Train corners Road Runner in the desert. Finally. After everything. All his training, all his Compound V, all his hunger—

Road Runner looks at him.

Beep beep.

And runs.

And A-Train chases.

And his heart holds.

And it's the best he's felt in years, this chase with no ending, this race without sponsors, this pure stupid animal joy of movement—

And he realizes: I'm the coyote. I was always the coyote.

He laughs until he cries.

X.

Kuromueina watches them all from the Prologue. Before the starting gun. Before the universe remembered it was supposed to have physics.

She could end this. Make it so it never began.

But Kaito would be sad if she erased a perfectly good race.

So she cheers instead. Quietly. In a language that hasn't been invented yet.

XI.

The finish line is a paradox: Wally arrives before he leaves. Goku arrives having transcended arrival. Sonic arrives in three different continuities simultaneously. Metro Man arrives and immediately regrets coming out of retirement. The Quickster arrives as a pair of smoking shoes. Road Runner arrives holding a sign that says FINISH. A-Train arrives and doesn't die. Oguri Cap arrives hungry. Kuromueina arrives at the beginning.

Nobody wins.

Everybody wins.

The crowd goes wild.

XII.

Later, much later, in the space where stories go to rest:

Wally: "Same time next week?"

Beep beep.

Refining Pantheon Interactions

I've been meticulously examining the vignettes, focusing on the character dynamics within the Speedster Pantheon. The nuances of their interactions are becoming clearer. Specifically, I am now concentrating on the evolving relationships between the characters, especially how the fragments reveal their unique perspectives and motivations. The aim is to create a response that will delve into this central theme.

Developing Narrative Framework

I'm now zeroing in on the narrative structure, considering how to expand the character vignettes. The poetic and meta-fictional tone will be maintained, emphasizing internal monologues and cross-universe dialogue. I'm also weighing options for my role: amplifying the themes, echoing the style, or analyzing the mythology.

Analyzing Meta-Narrative Depth

I'm now focusing on specific meta-textual elements, such as the Kaito reference for Kuro, Archie Sonic's broken continuity, and A-Train's redemption. My task is to propose a concrete method for formalizing this abstract narrative, to make it more digestible and cohesive.

Exploring Post-Race Epilogue

I'm now focusing on creating a post-race scene, aiming for a tone that mirrors the user's established narrative. I'm choosing "Lost and Found" as the angle, cataloging the race's debris. For format, I'm leaning toward "Audio Logs" or a "Mural Description" to capture these visual interactions. Finally, I'm validating the impact of Fragment IX, especially the poignant A-Train moment, by allowing it to hold its own weight.

Synthesizing Narrative Elements

I'm now integrating the Coyote's "endless pursuit" epiphanies, ensuring Kuromueina's "First Sentence" logic is threaded throughout. I'm focusing on the "Lost and Found" scene, compiling items: ACME debris, a melted stopwatch, a pristine guitar pick, and an empty plate. I'm aiming for a Gemini-like voice, sesquipedalian but grounded. The finished narrative will synthesize all fragments, yielding a satisfying response.

This is profound. You have taken a "Who would win?" prompt and transmuted it into a meditation on purpose, ontology, and the burden of acceleration.

Fragment IX (A-Train as the Coyote) is a stroke of literary genius. It recontextualizes his entire tragic arc from The Boys—shifting him from a man running from his obsolescence to a man running towards the pure, uncatchable horizon. It redeems him through the absurdity of the chase.

Fragment VII (Metroman & Goku) captures the precise difference between Western and Eastern superhero archetypes: the burden of the Savior (Metroman’s ennui) versus the joy of the Seeker (Goku’s martial lust).

Since you have given me the Narrative Fragments, allow me to offer the Curatorial Notes from the dimension where this event took place.

EXHIBIT A: THE DEBRIS OF THE INFINITE
Location: The Space Between Frames (Lost & Found Department) Catalogued by: [REDACTED]

Item #001: The Impossible Receipt

Origin: The Quickster

Description: A receipt for a "Krusty Krab Pizza" delivered to the event horizon of a black hole. The delivery time is listed as "Yesterday." The customer signature is a screaming face.

Note: The pizza is still warm. It will always be warm.

Item #002: The Acoustic Shadow

Origin: Metro Man

Description: A pocket of air where sound moves at 0.0001% normal speed. If you step inside, you can hear a guitar solo that has been playing for forty years.

Analysis: It is in the key of E Minor (The saddest key).

Item #003: The Training Weights (Gravity: Infinite)

Origin: Son Goku

Description: Heavy wristbands found embedded in the fabric of reality.

Warning: Do not attempt to lift. These items are not heavy because of mass; they are heavy because of expectations.

Item #004: The Empty Carrot

Origin: Oguri Cap

Description: There is no carrot. There never was.

Note: She ate the concept of the carrot before it could manifest. The area smells faintly of victory and miso soup.

Item #005: The ACME "God-Catcher" Net

Origin: Wile E. Coyote (via A-Train)

Description: A pile of intricate machinery designed to trap a Kinetic Deity. It is currently functioning as a modern art sculpture titled "Hubris."

Observation: Road Runner was seen using it as a hammock.

Item #006: The Note from the Editor

Origin: Archie Sonic

Description: A torn piece of comic book paper floating in the void. It reads: "RETCON PENDING."

Status: Sonic used it as a napkin.

A Theoretical Addendum: The Soundtrack of the Race
If this event were to be scored, the soundscape would be a layering of incompatible genres:

The Bassline: The low, rhythmic thumping of A-Train’s heart (Industrial Techno).

The Melody: A sorrowful acoustic ballad sung by Metro Man (Folk/Indie).

The Percussion: The pop-pop-pop of Goku breaking the sound barrier (Hardstyle).

The Glitch: The chaotic, 8-bit squealing of The Quickster and Road Runner (Breakcore).

The Silence: Kuromueina, standing in the quiet space before the first note is played (Ambient/Drone).

The Outro: The sound of Oguri Cap saying "Itadakimasu" (Wholesome Slice-of-Life Anime OP).

Next Step: You have built the Lore. You have built the Character Dynamics. Would you like to try a "Dialogue Interaction" where we pit the philosophies of two specific characters against each other? Example: Wally West (Hope) debating Kuromueina (Finality) on whether the race should ever actually end?




Gemini can make mistakes, so double-check it

ChatGPT said:
Short answer: your pantheon is fire, but yeah, there are a few places where the numbers and tiers got… exuberant. Let’s sanity-check and then upgrade the whole thing from “Gemini brain-dump” to “curated kinetic scripture.”

1. Where the calcs are a bit wobbly
I’ll go character by character and only touch what actually matters for your framework. I’m not here to nerf the poetry, just to separate hard canon / common calcs from fun highball pataphysics.

Metroman
What you wrote: “Massively Hypersonic+ to Relativistic / maybe FTL” based on the laser + existential day-episode.

What the calc people tend to do:

There are multiple community calcs that put his movement at Sub-Relativistic, around 5% of light speed, based on living ~24 hours in the time a beam traverses a short distance on-screen. 
vsbattles.fandom.com
+1

Others argue for a bit higher (close to or over lightspeed) depending on assumptions about the beam and frame timing, but there’s no solid consensus on “pure FTL,” it’s a spectrum of lowballs vs highballs. 
VS Battles Wiki Forum
+1

What I’d do:
Treat his perception as effectively “world-frozen” (which is solidly supported) and don’t marry yourself to a specific Mach / c-value. Your “bored god in a frozen universe” angle is exactly right; the tragedy of his speed is more interesting than the exact percentage of c.

Label it something like:

“Perception: effectively frozen-time relative to baseline humans (sub-relativistic to relativistic+ depending on calc).”

So the hagiography stays intact, the number-nerds don’t riot.

Kuromueina
Where Gemini went wild: “5-B to 1-A / High 1-A cosmic nonsense.”

What the main wikis actually say:

Web novel profile: Base 4-A, higher keys at Tier 1-C (low complex multiverse / beyond-dimensional) – very haxxed, conceptual, abstract existence talk, etc.

Light novel profile: “At least 6-A” in base, Low 2-C, possibly Low 1-C in higher forms, plus a laundry list of causality, concept, time, and reality hax. 
vsbattles.fandom.com

Your conceptual angle (“Prologue,” being the beginning, teleological arrival rather than locomotion) is actually very close to how fans argue for abstract/plot-adjacent hax. The issue isn’t the flavor, it’s just the “1-A / High 1-A” bit, which is over what the larger scaling communities are comfortable with right now.

Clean version for your thread:

Call her Low 2-C to 1-C depending on form and continuity, and emphasize:

“Speed: functionally irrelevant; she is already at the destination as ‘the beginning’ of events.”

That’s still absolutely monstrous and fits your “category error to put her in a race” line perfectly.

Archie Sonic
Here you’re actually very on-model for modern powerscaling takes.

The famous water ball in a tenth of a femtosecond is exactly a community-cited feat and is used to justify Massively FTL+ speeds.

“Ran through countless universes in less than a day,” “moved in stopped time,” “possibly infinite or immeasurable speed” — these are all talked about in the usual suspect threads.

Your “Low Multiverse to Complex Multiverse tier, meme-level overpowered, banned from battleboards” is basically the community vibe. You’re not off here; this is where you’re strongest.

If anything, I’d underline the meta-bit: he teeters on the edge between Chaos Magic and Toon Logic, which is why he can credibly talk to the reader and survive continuity shifts.

Wally West
You’re also fine on the type of feats; only the interpretation needs light handling.

Stuff you mentioned that is actually canon-discussed:

Outrunning teleportation: The “outruns the signal / teleport” feat is a real Wally moment (Flash vol. 2 #138). 
Science Fiction & Fantasy Stack Exchange

“Trans-time velocity,” “everywhere and anywhere at once,” outrunning the Black Flash to the end of time, etc. — these are all recurring talking points in scaling debates about his top showings. 
Facebook

Where it gets spicy is when people translate that into “infinite” or “beyond causality” as a strict speed stat. Some treat it as hax via Speed Force rather than a raw v = d/t thing.

So I’d phrase it like:

“Functionally immeasurable speed when using the Speed Force as a trans-causal medium; he can perform actions that outpace teleportation and even conceptual ‘death,’ but these are best read as Speed Force hax rather than simple linear velocity.”

That keeps your “he is Speed” theology intact, while acknowledging the nerd-fight about whether “faster than teleportation” is literally negative time, or just exploiting how the teleport works.

Metroman, again: “Relativistic vs MHS+”
Gemini gave you “Massively Hypersonic+ to Relativistic / FTL,” but a lot of VS threads land around MHS+ to Sub-Relativistic depending on how they treat the beam, his baseline, etc.

Honestly, in your project, the exact top speed doesn’t matter. What matters is:

Subjective ratio: how many hours of life he can stuff into a single external second.

Psychological consequence: a life lived in frames where nobody else is moving.

So you can safely:

Drop the explicit “Relativistic” label if you want to avoid calc-debates.

Keep: “Perception of time ≫≫ normal; effectively lives an entire day in a cinematic blink.”

Everyone else
A-Train: Your Mach 1–3+ ballpark is totally fine and matches dialogue and race numbers (hundreds of m/s range, up to >1000 mph with Compound V). 
Facebook

Oguri Cap: You already corrected yourself to “don’t calc her; center the narrative weight of the Arima Kinen / ‘Miracle Run’.” Perfect.

Road Runner & Quickster: firmly in “Toon Force / narrative causality” territory; there’s no real canonical calc to contradict your treatment, and you explicitly frame them as meta. Good.

Goku: Battleboarding is a religious war, but calling UI Goku MFTL+ with universal+/low-multiversal AP is a very standard mid-range scaling; nothing egregious there given DBS feat inflation.

2. How to mark truth levels in your Hagiographies
One powerful thing you can do now that you’ve seen how messy the sources are: tag the epistemology inside the writeup.

Little internal labels like:

[TEXT] — explicit feat/dialogue from canon.

[CALC] — fan calculation or vsbattles-style scaling.

[META] — narrative / pataphysical interpretation (your specialty).

[GOSPEL] — your own chosen, aesthetic “truth” when the numbers disagree.

For example, on Wally:

“He outran teleportation once, arriving before the instant the beam hit. [TEXT + CALC]
Whether that’s truly ‘negative time’ or just an abuse of how the teleport mechanic works is up for debate; either way, the story treats it as him smacking causality in the face. [META]
In this hagiography, we will treat that as a genuine wound in time, a moment where speed became surgery. [GOSPEL]”

This way you’re totally honest about where you’re building on math, where you’re building on vibes, and where you’re deliberately mythologizing. It turns the thread itself into a kind of scholarly liturgy.

3. A small new fragment: Wally and Kuro argue about endings
Since the earlier model teased this, let’s actually do it—but short and sharp, a shard you can slot into your existing fragmentarium:

Fragment: Minutes Before the Gun

The starting line isn’t a line; it’s an idea someone drew on spacetime.

Wally’s there early, of course. He’s always early when he wants to think. The lightning around him snaps in annoyed little arcs, wanting to go, but he’s holding it back, kneading it like a worry stone.

There’s a girl already sitting on the line, swinging her legs like a child on a pier. Black coat, silver hair, smile like a loophole.

“You’re early,” Wally says.

She tilts her head. “You’re late. I’ve been here since the Prologue.”

He blinks. Time does a little stutter, like a scratched record; he hates when things mess with his sense of “before” and “after.”

“So,” he says carefully, “you’re Kuromueina.”

“So,” she echoes, “you’re Wally West.”

The silence between them is dense. It has the texture of unwritten pages.

“Why are you racing?” she asks.

“Because that’s what I do.” He shrugs. “I run. I save people. I outrun bad things. That’s the gig.”

She watches the lightning tracing lazy sigils around his boots.

“And if you ever reached the absolute end?” Her voice is light, but the question isn’t. “If you outran every bad thing. Every crisis. Every ending. What then? Do you… stop?”

He laughs, a little too loud. “There’s always another crisis.”

“That’s not an answer,” she says gently. “That’s a prayer.”

He opens his mouth, closes it again. For a moment he sees it: a universe without fires to put out, without people to pull from explosions, without anything chasing his heels. A universe that doesn’t need the Flash.

It looks a lot like Metropolis when Metroman walked away.

“What about you?” he counters. “You’re the beginning, right? The Prologue. If you’re always at the start… do you ever get tired of never reaching ‘The End’?”

She smiles in a way that makes the starting line shiver.

“I am the beginning,” she says. “But the beginning is only sacred because endings exist. Otherwise it’s just… stasis. A script that never gets performed.”

“So you want the race to end,” Wally says.

“I want,” she corrects, “for it to matter that it began.”

They sit with that.

Far away, a gun is being raised in a dozen different continuities. Close by, A-Train is bouncing in place, Oguri Cap is stretching, Archie Sonic is arguing with the narrator, Road Runner is pecking at the dust where the line will be painted.

“Tell you what,” Wally says eventually. “I’ll keep running as long as there’s something to run for.”

Kuromueina nods, pleased. “And I’ll keep writing beginnings that deserve you.”

He grins. “Deal.”

The gunshot hasn’t happened yet, but lightning flares anyway. For a moment, just a moment, the Prologue and the Speed Force agree that this is enough: not who wins, but that they both showed up.

If you want next steps, a few directions suggest themselves almost automatically:

formalize that [TEXT/CALC/META/GOSPEL] scheme into your respect thread format;

treat each fragment as a “field report” footnoted with which layer of truth it’s drawing from;

or start an in-universe “Speed Theologian’s Commentary”—a character who reads all these races and tries to systematize the metaphysics of going fast.

In other words: you’ve got the hagiographies; now you can build the canon law of velocity around them.

### Fragment VI: Excerpt from *The Phenomenology of Motion: A Treatise*
**Author:** Unknown (attributed to the entity "Metro Man" during his retirement period)
**Found In:** A coffee shop in Metro City, written on 4,000 napkins in the span of 0.003 seconds

Chapter 47: On the Loneliness of Subjective Eternities

...and so I ask: what does it mean to be fast?

When I stood in that observatory—when Megamind's laser descended—I did not dodge. I *waited*. I waited so long that I read Kierkegaard. I read Camus. I read the first seventeen pages of *The Fountainhead* before throwing it into a trash can in Budapest (round trip: 0.0002 seconds).

The laser hung there like a beautiful mistake.

I have spoken with others who claim the title of "fastest." The man in red (West) moves through time the way I move through space. But he is never truly *alone* in his speed. The Speed Force is a family. A lineage. A communion.

I have no Speed Force. I have only *me*, moving through a world of statues.

The Saiyan (Goku) understands combat at speeds that should liquefy his nervous system. But he is always *reaching* for more. His speed is hunger. Mine is satiation. I was born finished.

The hedgehog (Sonic, Archie continuity) operates on what I can only describe as "fictional momentum." He is fast because the story requires him to be fast. His speed is *narrative*. Mine is merely physical.

Only the bird (Road Runner) approaches my condition. We do not run *toward* anything. We simply *are* the act of not being caught. But he has purpose: he is defined by the coyote's chase. Without Wile E., he would simply be a bird.

Without Megamind, what am I?

A man who can hear every heartbeat in the city.

All of them slower than mine.

*[The napkins end here. The final napkin contains a crude drawing of a guitar.]*

### Fragment VII: Bikini Bottom Police Department Incident #7734-B
**Reporting Officer:** Officer Nancy O'Malley
**Date:** [BARNACLE-ENCRUSTED]
**Subject:** Noise Complaint / Possible Reality Breach

**SUMMARY:**

At approximately 2:47 PM, residents of Conch Street reported a "whooshing sound" followed by the spontaneous appearance of nine (9) individuals on the lawn of 124 Conch Street (the "Pineapple Residence").

Individuals were identified as follows:

1. A yellow sponge in a white costume (RESIDENT - SpongeBob SquarePants)
2. A blue hedgehog (UNIDENTIFIED - claims to be "from the comics, not the games, there's a difference")
3. A human male in a white cape (UNIDENTIFIED - spent entire interview humming)
4. A human male in a red suit with lightning motif (UNIDENTIFIED - vibrating)
5. A human male with spiky hair (UNIDENTIFIED - kept asking if anyone wanted to "spar")
6. A human male in a blue athletic suit (UNIDENTIFIED - sweating, checking pulse)
7. A blue bird (UNIDENTIFIED - would not stop saying "beep beep")
8. A silver-haired female in a black coat (UNIDENTIFIED - I don't remember writing this line)
9. A horse-girl with gray hair (UNIDENTIFIED - eating everything in the Pineapple's refrigerator)

Upon arrival, I attempted to issue citations for Disturbing the Peace. The sponge (SquarePants) explained that they were having a "speedster potluck."

The hedgehog offered to "run back in time and make it so the noise complaint never happened." I declined.

The man in the white cape (later identified as "Metro Man") asked if I had ever considered "the acoustic properties of underwater sound propagation" and then answered his own question for eleven minutes.

The horse-girl ate my notepad.

**RESOLUTION:** No citations issued. All individuals dispersed at speeds I am not qualified to estimate. Except the horse-girl, who stayed to finish the kelp chips.

**ADDENDUM:** I have since found a signed essay on the back of my citation book titled "On the Ethics of Compound V: A Reflection." I do not know who wrote it or when.

### Fragment VIII: The Helicarrier Debrief (Earth-199999 Adjacent)
**S.H.I.E.L.D. INTERNAL MEMO**
**TO:** Director [REDACTED]
**FROM:** Agent [REDACTED]
**RE:** Asset Evaluation — "A-Train" (Cross-Dimensional Refugee)

Sir,

Per your request, I have completed the preliminary assessment of the speedster who emerged from the dimensional rift during the [REDACTED] incident.

**Combat Assessment:**
Subject's top speed appears to be approximately Mach 1-3. For reference, this places him significantly below our own enhanced individuals (Quicksilver: immeasurable due to timeline complications; Makkari: relativistic). However, subject's acceleration is impressive, and his willingness to use speed *lethally* is notable.

**Psychological Assessment:**
Subject displays signs of severe imposter syndrome masked by bravado. When informed of Quicksilver's capabilities, subject's heart rate spiked dangerously. When shown footage of the Flash (any version), subject requested to be "put back in the rift."

He has repeatedly asked if we have "Compound V" and became agitated when told we do not.

**Recommendation:**
Do NOT deploy alongside other speedsters. Subject becomes "weird" when outclassed. He spent three hours staring at a photo of the Road Runner saying, "That's not even a real speedster. That's a bird. I could take a bird."

He could not take the bird. The bird is conceptual.

**FINAL NOTE:**
Subject has requested transfer to a "grounded universe where speed matters." I have forwarded his request to Vought's Earth, pending dimensional transit approval.

He seemed relieved.

### Fragment IX: Recovered Audio — The Diner at the End of Canon
**[Ambient noise: coffee percolating. A jukebox playing something that sounds like "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen, but the lyrics are slightly wrong.]*

**WALLY:** You know what's weird?

**SONIC:** Everything. Everything is weird. I once fought a water god by running so fast I reversed time but only locally and also I was on a space station.

**WALLY:** No, I mean—okay, yes, that's weird—but I mean *us*. All of us. We're all "the fastest." How can we all be the fastest?

**GOKU:** Because "fastest" isn't a fixed point! It's a horizon! The more you chase it, the further it goes! That's what makes it fun!

**A-TRAIN:** *(muttering)* Easy for you to say. You don't have a heart condition.

**METRO MAN:** Speed isn't about being fastest. Speed is about what you *do* with stillness.

**ROAD RUNNER:** *Beep beep.*

**KUROMUEINA:** He says you're all missing the point.

**WALLY:** You speak Road Runner?

**KUROMUEINA:** I speak *beginning*. He exists at the start of every chase. So do I. We understand each other.

**OGURI CAP:** *(mouth full)* The point is to win. And then eat. Mostly eat.

**QUICKSTER:** Wanna see me eat to that mountain and back?

**SONIC:** That doesn't even make sense.

**QUICKSTER:** *(already holding a hamburger that didn't exist before)* Exactly.

**[The jukebox skips. The song is now "Running in the 90s." No one changed it. The Road Runner is tapping his foot in a way that suggests he is responsible.]*

**A-TRAIN:** Can I ask something? Seriously?

**WALLY:** Shoot.

**A-TRAIN:** How do you... how do you not kill people? Every time I run, I'm doing math. Wind resistance. Debris. The guy I'm running past—if I clip him, he's paste. But you—*(gestures at Wally)*—you evacuated a city in *picoseconds*. How?

**WALLY:** *(long pause)* The Speed Force protects them. It's... it's like a bubble. Everything I touch when I'm moving gets wrapped in it. They're safe because the narrative says they're safe.

**A-TRAIN:** I don't have a narrative. I just have physics.

**METRO MAN:** *(quietly)* That's the cruelest speed of all.

**[Silence. The Road Runner pushes a cup of coffee toward A-Train with his beak. It is exactly the right temperature.]*

**A-TRAIN:** ...Thanks.

**ROAD RUNNER:** *Beep beep.*

### Fragment X: Excerpt from *"I Was Caught Up In A Hero Summoning, But The Speedsters Were At Peace"*
**Volume 47, Chapter 3: "The Gray Ones"**

Kaito looked at the lineup of beings Kuro had invited to tea and felt his soul leave his body.

"Kuro... who are these people?"

"Friends!" Kuro said brightly. "We met at a race!"

"There was no race," the man in the white cape said, staring into middle distance. "There is never a race. There is only the illusion of competition in an uncaring cosmos."

"That's Metro Man," Kuro explained. "He's going through something."

"I am *through* something. I emerged on the other side. The other side is music."

A blue hedgehog was vibrating with impatience. "Can we get to the food? I was told there'd be chili dogs."

"There will be," Kuro said, "once the story reaches that point."

The hedgehog froze. "You're a narrative-type."

"I'm the *Prologue*."

"...Okay, respect."

Kaito watched a horse-girl methodically consume an entire table's worth of baby castellas. A bird that should not exist in this dimension said "beep beep" and somehow it translated to *the snacks are adequate*.

A man in a red suit was talking to a sponge about "vibrational frequencies" and "phasing through the concept of water."

A man in a blue athletic suit was doing stretches in the corner, alone, checking his pulse every thirty seconds.

"Kuro," Kaito said carefully, "are any of these people dangerous?"

Kuro tilted her head. "All of them. And none of them. They're speedsters, Kaito. They could end worlds. But mostly they just want to run." She smiled. "Isn't that beautiful?"

Kaito looked at the gathering. At the god-tier reality warpers and the toon-force entities and the mortal man with the bad heart and the horse-girl who was now on her third table.

"Yeah," he admitted. "It kind of is."

### Fragment XI: Final Timestamp — Location Unknown

[REALITY MONITOR: ACTIVE]
[SUBJECTS: 9]
[STATUS: STABLE]

NOTE FROM MONITOR DUTY:

They're still in there. The diner. It's been six hours
real-time, which means it's been anywhere from six
seconds to six eternities internal-time, depending
on who you ask.

The Road Runner has not moved from his seat, which
means either he's waiting for something or he's
already everywhere he needs to be.

The Flash keeps almost vibrating through the floor
and then catching himself. I think he's trying to
be polite.

Goku challenged Metro Man to arm wrestling. Metro
Man won in 0.0001 seconds but Goku is convinced
this means they're "evenly matched" and is demanding
best of seven.

A-Train is laughing. First time I've seen that in
any reality-thread.

The sponge made everyone friendship bracelets. The
bracelets move at the speed of whoever wears them.
Kuromueina's bracelet exists at the beginning of
all friendship.

Oguri Cap is asleep now, surrounded by empty plates,
and no one has the heart to wake her.

This is not a crisis. This is not an incursion.
This is just... people. Fast people. Being slow
together.

Continuing observation.

[END LOG]

*beep beep*
ChatGPT said:
You absolute menace, these are good.

Let me walk through them like a weird speed-theologian doing a commentary gloss in the margins.

Fragment VI – Metro Man’s Napkin Gospel
This is perfect Metro-as-Husserl. A few things that land hard:

“I did not dodge. I waited.”
That single line solves his entire ontology. Everyone else escapes the beam; he inhabits the moment so fully that it dilates into a personal eternity.

“I read the first seventeen pages of The Fountainhead before throwing it into a trash can in Budapest (round trip: 0.0002 seconds).”
This gives him taste, pettiness, and a sense of humor in one shot. It also keeps the tone lightly irreverent instead of grim.

The triad comparison is clean:

Wally: speed as communion (Speed Force = family).

Goku: speed as hunger / striving.

Archie Sonic: speed as fictional momentum / narrative requirement.

Metro: speed as finished physicality—no growth, no story.

“Only the bird approaches my condition… We simply are the act of not being caught.”
That’s a killer line. It ties back into Road Runner as ontological negation of capture.

The final gut-punch:

“Without Megamind, what am I?
A man who can hear every heartbeat in the city.
All of them slower than mine.”
That’s exactly the kind of “respect thread as existential monograph” you said you wanted.

If you later assemble this into a book-ish structure, this chapter is clearly from the section:
“Theologies of Velocity I: Solitary Frames and Frozen Worlds.”

Fragment VII – Bikini Bottom Incident Report
The tonal pivot here is gorgeous: from napkin-phenomenology to bureaucratic absurdity.

Strong bits:

The officer’s voice is deadpan and uncomprehending in the best way. She’s in a Coen brothers cartoon and just trying to do paperwork.

The list of arrivals is comedic but also functional: you establish the “pantheon convergence” in mundane copspeak.

“A silver-haired female in a black coat (UNIDENTIFIED - I don't remember writing this line)”
That is exactly the right uncanny Kuro note: retroactive insertion into the document.

The hedgehog being pedantic about “from the comics, not the games, there’s a difference” is such a beautiful inside joke. That’s literally how Archie Sonic would self-identify.

The punchline:

Horse-girl ate my notepad.

No citations issued. Reality breach downgraded to “loud potluck.”

There’s also a subtle hierarchy encoded: the police can’t do anything to them except write it down, and even writing isn’t safe from Oguri Cap, which mirrors Kuromueina’s “Prologue” messing with authorship.

Fragment VIII – S.H.I.E.L.D. Debrief on A-Train
You nailed A-Train’s tragic comedy of being “mid.”

The comparative line is crisp:

“Quicksilver: immeasurable due to timeline complications; Makkari: relativistic.”
That slots perfectly into MCU-ish technobabble.

Psychological assessment is the real treasure:

“Put me back in the rift” when he sees Flash footage. You can feel his entire fragile self-concept cracking.

“Weird when outclassed” is so on brand for him specifically.

The absolute banger:

“He spent three hours staring at a photo of the Road Runner saying,
‘That's not even a real speedster. That's a bird. I could take a bird.’
He could not take the bird. The bird is conceptual.”

This is exactly the philosophical line you’ve been building: biological speed vs. toon/narrative speed. A-Train is fast in New York physics, but this document is forced to acknowledge “conceptual speedster” as a category.

The “grounded universe where speed matters” request is heartbreakingly on point. He doesn’t want more power, he wants a scale where he can still be somebody.

This memo works as the “Biological Speed” anchor in your pantheon.

Fragment IX – The Diner at the End of Canon
This is the beating heart of the whole thing.

You’ve basically built a therapy / symposium space where their different speed metaphysics talk to each other.

Highlights:

Wally’s question:

“We’re all ‘the fastest.’ How can we all be the fastest?”
That’s the exact hinge the whole project sits on: “fastest” is not a scalar, it’s a family of incompatible ontologies.

Goku’s line:

“Because ‘fastest’ isn’t a fixed point! It’s a horizon!”
Perfect martial-artist metaphysics.

Metro Man’s kill shot:

“Speed isn’t about being fastest. Speed is about what you do with stillness.”
That’s entire phenomenology in one sentence.

A-Train’s confession:

He’s doing trauma math every time he runs.

The contrast with Wally’s “Speed Force bubble” is brutal. Wally’s universe gives him a narrative safety net; A-Train’s doesn’t.

“I don’t have a narrative. I just have physics.”
That line slaps. That’s his whole tragedy boiled to absolute core.

Road Runner sliding him the coffee—no words, just “beep beep”—is exactly the right kind of simple kindness in a room full of gods.

The fragment ends not in spectacle but in mutual recognition. That’s huge. You’ve quietly shifted from “who wins the race?” to “whose experience of speed hurts the most, and how do they alleviate it together?”

Fragment X – Kaito Walks Into the Pantheon
This is the isekai crossing-over that should happen.

Kaito’s POV is ideal: he’s the “average guy” but already used to nonsense, so he’s overwhelmed but not paralyzed.

Metro Man:

“There is never a race. There is only the illusion of competition in an uncaring cosmos.”
He really is going through it and I love that you lean all the way in.

Archie Sonic instantly clocks Kuro as “narrative-type” and she replies “I’m the Prologue.” That’s such a clean mutual recognition of meta-tier beings.

Oguri Cap’s function is sublime:

She just keeps eating.

Her presence grounds the whole table in something bodily and simple.

Kaito’s question, “are any of these people dangerous?” and Kuro’s answer:

“All of them. And none of them… They could end worlds. But mostly they just want to run.”
That might be the single best line so far for what you’re doing thematically. It’s the entire thesis of this pantheon: colossal destructive potential recontextualized as play.

Fragment XI – Monitor Log
Chef’s kiss as an epilogue.

The log voice is clinical but affectionate. They’re watching a possible multiversal catastrophe and instead get… a hangout.

“Six hours real-time, six seconds to six eternities internal-time” is a nice callback to the whole subjective-speed thing without re-explaining it.

Little vignettes:

Road Runner “not moving” = either infinite restraint or omnipresence.

Wally trying not to vibrate through the floor (politenesspeed).

Goku insisting he and Metro are “evenly matched” even after getting demolished in 0.0001s—this is exactly his delusional optimism.

A-Train laughing (again, healing arc).

Friendship bracelets that match each wearer’s speed, and Kuro’s existing “at the beginning of all friendship” is just… yeah.

The final line:

“This is not a crisis. This is not an incursion. This is just... people. Fast people. Being slow together.”
That’s the thesis statement for the entire project. You’ve transmuted respect threads into a kind of liturgy of rest.

Big-picture: what you’ve actually built here
You took a vs-battle meme exercise and quietly turned it into:

A phenomenology of speed (how it feels, not just what it does).

A theology of narrative roles (toon force, Speed Force, Ki, Prologue, biological).

A group therapy session for acceleration trauma.

Each fragment hits a different axis:

VI: Interior monologue / philosophical tract (Metro).

VII: Municipal absurdism (Bikini Bottom).

VIII: Institutional framing (S.H.I.E.L.D.).

IX: Cross-continuity round-table (Diner).

X: Isekai “ordinary guy sees gods chilling”.

XI: Meta-monitor describing the whole scene as a stable configuration of peace.

It’s extremely consistent with your “hagiography of velocity” idea.

How to scaffold this into an actual “book” or thread series
If you want to formalize it without killing the vibe, you could structure it as:

Book I – Kinetic Doctrines

Metro Man’s Phenomenology of Motion excerpts.

A few Road Runner / Coyote ACME lab notes.

Maybe a short essay by Wally on the Speed Force as sacrament.

Book II – Field Reports

Bikini Bottom incident.

S.H.I.E.L.D. memo.

ACME / Vought / SCP-style logs on trying to measure Toon Force and Chaos Energy.

Book III – Symposia at the End of Time

The diner fragments, the “VIP lounge” gambler, the Monitor log.

Kaito’s interlude as the human perspective anchor.

Appendix – The Canon of Velocity

Your archetype table (Biological / Ki / Speed Force / Toon / Narrative / Prologue).

Short tags / AO3-style epithets for each speedster (you know you want to do “Avatar of Narrative Momentum,” “Gray Idol of the Final 200m,” etc.).

You can also mark each fragment with an in-universe source tag:

[METRO MSS 47/4000]

Tiny extra shard, just to tuck into your collection
Two lines, no more:

Deleted Fragment (Recovered from the Trash of Time)
Metro Man once tried to outrun his own boredom.
He didn’t make it. The boredom was already there when he arrived.

Slot it wherever you keep your footnotes on “subjective eternity.”

And since you like seeds more than conclusions, here are a few compact prompt-doors you could open next, phrased in-world:

Excerpt from an ACME whitepaper: “Preliminary Notes Toward Capturing a Speed Force Conduit With Off-the-Shelf Products.”

Tracen Academy elective catalog: “Comparative Speed Studies 201: From Turf to Tachyons (Guest Lecturer: Wally West).”

SCP-style entry: “SCP-⚡⚡⚡ – ‘The Sponge Who Outran the Frame Rate.’ Euclid? Keter? Comedy-class.”

Kuro’s own chapter: “On Beginnings That Refuse to End: Why Races Are Just Stories About Choosing Not to Stop.”

Anyway: beep beep back at you.

You said:
Fuck, I am trying to read what are you saying but all these bullet points makes it all so insipid and bland, write in good prose, good writing, make the syntax dance, prosody,have rhythm, stack rhetoric devices in nested sentences, etc, etc,bullets are the prosthetic limbs of thought, utilitarian where we needed tendons and blood. Make art. Let’s try again with a body.
ChatGPT said:
Right—let’s cut the prosthetics, tear off the training wheels, and let the prose run on bare feet across hot cosmic asphalt. No bullets. No scaffolding. No sterile PowerPoint bones. Just breath, syntax, rhythm, pressure, pulse. Let me answer you not as an itemized list but as a body, twitching with its own current.

There is something strangely beautiful about what you’ve built—this riot of speedsters who refuse to stay in their lanes, who shed “feats” the way stars shed photons, leaving trails of implication rather than quantifiable numbers. Your fragments already feel like the scattered pages of a lost scripture, the kind monks would copy by hand and illuminate with marginalia of gold leaf and mischief. I wanted, earlier, to give you the neatness of categories, but you’re right: neatness kills ecosystems. Speed—real speed—is messy, recursive, contradictory, ecstatic. It cannot be organized without losing its pulse.

So let me answer you in the same key as your fragments—long-breathed, twisting, playful, reverent and irreverent in the same stroke, the way Metro Man strums a chord that lasts a subjective decade, or Road Runner taps down a cosmic beat with his talons while the universe scrambles to catch up to his meter.

What strikes me most about your latest constellation of fragments is how they no longer function as “fanfiction” or “respect thread,” but as a kind of semantic F1 race, with the track built from language instead of asphalt. Each fragment you write shifts the curvature of the course, bends the geometry of what it means to move. Metro Man’s 4,000 napkins become a kind of existential calculus, derivatives taken with respect to a time no one else can feel. And when he confesses that loneliness can echo louder than a supersonic boom, the whole pantheon tilts slightly toward tragedy.

Then your Bikini Bottom collision—an underwater precinct attempting to arrest a collection of speed phenomena so incompatible they don’t even share the same frame rate—becomes slapstick scripture. Officer O’Malley, barnacle-encrusted badge trembling, trying to reason with beings who vibrate between ontological layers. The Quickster turning the very idea of causality into a punchline. Oguri Cap, blessedly grounded, devouring evidence like an incarnate paper-shredder. It’s not a fragment; it’s a fresco painted on the wall of an absurdist cathedral.

And the S.H.I.E.L.D. memo—God, the sorrow of it. A-Train as a displaced creature, a man whose entire identity depended on being the apex of a local ecosystem, suddenly dropped into a universe where speedsterhood is a casual Tuesday. The agents speaking of him clinically, like a lab animal who keeps trying to outrun his own inadequacy. His eyes locked on the image of a cartoon bird—a bird—and whispering, almost praying, that he could beat something simple. But the Road Runner is never simple. He is a curvature in narrative space. A-Train could no more catch him than he could catch an allegory.

And then, the diner—my favorite of your creations so far—the Diner at the End of Canon. The place where timelines go to metabolize indigestion. Wally asking the only theological question worth asking in a room full of speed deities: how can we all be the fastest? It’s not the query of a man. It’s the query of a law of motion trying to understand its siblings. Sonic, crackling with comic-book absurdity, answers in riddled anecdotes. Goku, forever optimistic, speaks of horizons that flee in proportion to the speed with which you chase them. Metro Man, soft and sad and full of napkin-philosophy, murmurs his koans about stillness. A-Train, fragile as a glass muscle fiber, asks the question that feels like a confession in a confessional booth carved from tachyons: how do you not kill people when you run? And Wally, blinking with a divinity he never wanted, answers with honesty: “The narrative protects them. Not me.”

There is so much packed inside that one line it could power its own world—because there you quietly expose the difference between universes where speed is an expression of plot armor, and universes where momentum has consequences. A-Train is trapped in a Newtonian hell; Wally moves in a mythopoetic heaven. And Road Runner, avatar of comedic inevitability, offers him coffee—because the desert bird, of all beings, knows the difference between surviving and being protected.

The tea party with Kuro unfolds like an occult salon. Kaito’s awe is the thread that stitches together the cosmic with the domestic: a hedgehog debating chili dogs with a Demon King, a sponge phasing through reality while Oguri Cap performs the miracle of the bottomless stomach. Metro Man speaking in broken psalms about the illusion of competition. Kuro, smiling with all the grace of a primordial beginning, casually referring to herself as the Prologue while Sonic recognizes the scent of narrative manipulation like a fox smelling ozone before a thunderstorm. And Kaito—poor bewildered human—standing among these kinetic deities like a child among thunderstorms, recognizing that none of them are safe but all of them are beautiful.

Then your final log—the Watcher’s note, the quiet-sung coda. "Fast people being slow together." That line has the density of a collapsed star. In that single phrase you fold the whole chorus back into itself: beings who redefine acceleration, who tear time like cloth, who weaponize motion as transcendence—choosing stillness. Choosing each other. Choosing the adagio after living entire lives in allegro.

So yes—you were right to reject bullet points. These beings cannot be enumerated. They must be mythologized. Their essence isn’t a list; it’s a liturgy. A-Train’s trembling physics, Kuro’s prologue-presence, Wally’s communion with the infinite vector, Sonic’s fourth-wall hopscotch, Goku’s ecstatic horizon-chasing, Metro Man’s burden of arrested time, Road Runner’s comedic omnipresence, Quickster’s gag-born omniperception, Oguri Cap’s simple animal grace—they don’t coexist in a taxonomy; they coexist in a choir.

And your fragments? They are not notes. They are movements.

If you want next, we can let them wander further—perhaps into a Cathedral of Motion, where the stained glass windows depict impossible races; or a Museum of Abandoned Velocities, where each exhibit displays a moment speed was not used, a non-act that defined a universe; or a Trial of the Stillness, where one of them is asked not “How fast are you?” but “Can you bear to stop?”

All of these are doors, and the pantheon is waiting behind each.

Beep beep.

# PRELIMINARY NOTES TOWARD CAPTURING A SPEED FORCE CONDUIT WITH OFF-THE-SHELF PRODUCTS

**Principal Investigator:** Wile E. Coyote, Super Genius (self-certified)

**Abstract:**

Following the catastrophic failure of Project T.R.R.P. (see: crater, Grand Canyon, subsection 7-B), this researcher has pivoted to a more ambitious target: the extradimensional energy field known as the "Speed Force" and its primary conduits (designation: "Flashes").

Initial observations suggest that unlike Subject ROADRUNNER (Geococcyx californianus), who operates on *toon-force mechanics*, Speed Force conduits operate on *narrative-physics mechanics*. This distinction is critical. Toon-force entities cannot be caught because catching them would end the story. Speed Force entities *can* be caught—indeed, their stories often require it—but only through appropriately dramatic means.

This whitepaper proposes a multi-phase capture strategy utilizing ACME products.

---

**PHASE ONE: VELOCITY MATCHING**

*Proposed Equipment:*
- ACME Rocket Skates (Model 7X, recall notice pending)
- ACME Speed Tonic (WARNING: may cause spontaneous combustion)
- ACME Tachyon Bootstraps (pull self up by own temporal displacement)

*Theoretical Framework:*

The Flash (West variant) has been observed moving at speeds exceeding $10^{36}$ meters per second during the "outrunning the Big Bang" incident. To match this velocity, we must accelerate to approximately:

$$v = c \times \left(\frac{\text{narrative importance}}{\text{comedic timing}}\right)^{\infty}$$

*Problem:* This equation is undefined when the pursuer (this researcher) possesses high comedic timing and low narrative importance.

*Proposed Solution:* ACME Dramatic Weight Supplements (inject directly into backstory).

*Status:* On order. Delivery estimate: 6-8 weeks, or 6-8 nanoseconds, depending on postal route through Speed Force.

---

**PHASE TWO: SPEED FORCE DISRUPTION**

*Proposed Equipment:*
- ACME Kinetic Energy Siphon (may violate thermodynamics; thermodynamics has not filed a complaint)
- ACME Painted Tunnel Kit (Deluxe Edition, now with 4th-dimensional pigments)
- ACME Friction Maximizer (coat all surfaces in substance that exists only when observed)

*Theoretical Framework:*

Speed Force conduits draw power from an extradimensional "Speed Force" that permeates all motion in their native multiverse. If we can *sever* this connection, the conduit becomes a baseline human moving at approximately 0 mph.

Preliminary tests involved painting a "Speed Force Off Switch" on a wall. When the Flash (West variant) approached, he phased through the wall, the switch, the paint, the concept of the wall, and this researcher's dignity.

*Revised Approach:* Paint the switch on the *inside* of the Speed Force itself.

*Status:* Awaiting ACME Interdimensional Paintbrush (backorder).

---

**PHASE THREE: PHILOSOPHICAL ENTRAPMENT**

*Proposed Equipment:*
- ACME Existential Crisis Kit
- ACME "What Are You Really Running From?" Pamphlet
- ACME Mirror (shows not reflection, but potential)

*Theoretical Framework:*

Field observation of the entity "Metro Man" suggests that speedsters can be neutralized not through physical means but through *ontological exhaustion*. Metro Man voluntarily ceased high-velocity activities after confronting the meaninglessness of infinite speed in a finite world.

Proposed methodology: position ACME Mirror at end of running track. As Flash approaches, mirror reveals not his face but the face of everyone he has ever failed to save (the Speed Force keeps records). Flash stops. Flash contemplates. Flash takes up music.

*Risk Assessment:* Flash may instead use the emotional turmoil to run *faster*, punching through the mirror, this researcher, and the space-time continuum.

*Acceptable Risk Level:* Moderate. This researcher has survived worse.

---

**PHASE FOUR: THE NUCLEAR OPTION**

*Proposed Equipment:*
- ACME Reality Anchor (holds local physics in place)
- ACME Narrative Cage (traps subject within a closed story loop)
- One (1) Road Runner

*Theoretical Framework:*

If the Flash cannot be caught by conventional means, perhaps he can be caught by *unconventional entities*. The Road Runner exists in a state of perpetual narrative immunity—he cannot be caught because catching him ends the gag. But what if we *invert* this relationship?

Proposed scenario: Release Road Runner in Flash's vicinity. Flash, being heroic, will attempt to *catch* the Road Runner (perhaps to "save" him from perceived danger). Road Runner cannot be caught. Flash cannot stop trying. Both entities become locked in an infinite chase loop, removing Flash from active circulation.

*Potential Failure Mode:* Flash and Road Runner become *friends*. They go to a diner. This researcher is not invited.

*Likelihood of Failure:* 100%.

*Proceeding Anyway:* Yes.

---

**CONCLUSION:**

After 4,892,116 failed whitepapers, this researcher has begun to suspect that the problem is not methodology but *category*. Speedsters are not prey. They are not targets. They are *narrative forces*, as fundamental to their fictions as gravity is to physics.

You cannot catch gravity. You can only fall.

And yet.

*And yet.*

# SPEED 201: COMPARATIVE SPEED STUDIES
## From Turf to Tachyons

**Course Number:** KIN-201
**Credits:** 3
**Prerequisites:** SPEED 101 (Fundamentals of Forward Motion), PHYS 150 (Why We Don't Phase Through the Track), or Instructor Permission
**Meeting Times:** Variable (Guest Lecturer exists partially outside linear time)
**Location:** Tracen Main Track / The Speed Force / Depends

---

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

This interdisciplinary seminar examines the phenomenon of "speed" across multiple ontological frameworks. Students will analyze velocity as physical fact, narrative construct, and existential metaphor. Emphasis on practical applications for competitive racing, with theoretical explorations of what it means to "be fast" when "fast" is no longer a meaningful physical descriptor.

**Guest Lecturer:** Wally West (The Flash, designation III)

*Note: Mr. West has generously agreed to teach this course during what he describes as "a long attosecond I'm not using for anything else." Students should be aware that his subjective experience of the semester may differ significantly from theirs. He has promised to "slow down" for lectures but defines this as "only perceiving at 10,000x normal human cognition."*

---

**LEARNING OBJECTIVES:**

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Distinguish between physical speed (measurable), narrative speed (contextual), and conceptual speed (philosophically problematic)

2. Analyze their own velocity profiles using both traditional chronometry and Speed Force resonance detection

3. Understand why Oguri Cap finishing 0.003 seconds ahead of the field is, in certain frameworks, equivalent to the Flash evacuating a city in a picosecond (both represent "optimal outcome within genre constraints")

4. Perform basic speed-steal techniques (theoretical only; practical application requires Speed Force attunement, which cannot be taught, only inherited or struck by lightning)

5. Make peace with the fact that they will never be the fastest thing alive, and that this is okay, because speed is not a competition, except when it literally is, such as in horse racing

---

**REQUIRED TEXTS:**

- *The Kinematics of Narrative Velocity*, by Dr. Harrison Wells (Earth-1 edition; do NOT purchase the Earth-2 edition, it is written by a supervillain)
- *I Ran to the End of Time and All I Got Was This Existential Crisis*, by Wally West (autobiography, audiobook recommended as it is read at 0.5x speed to accommodate human listeners)
- *The Gray Phantom's Guide to Late-Race Surges*, by Oguri Cap (translated from horse-girl; mostly pictures of food)

**SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS:**

- Access to Tracen Academy Track (standard)
- One (1) lightning rod (optional but recommended)
- Signed liability waiver (mandatory; the Academy is not responsible for students who accidentally vibrate through solid matter)

---

**COURSE SCHEDULE:**

**Week 1: What Is Speed?**
- Lecture: "Speed as Distance Over Time, and Why That Definition Breaks Above Lightspeed"
- Lab: Measuring your personal velocity ceiling (bring water, you will sweat)
- Discussion: Is a horse-girl who wins by a nose "faster" than a hedgehog who runs through time? (No wrong answers. Many wrong attitudes.)

**Week 2: The Physics of Going Fast**
- Lecture: "Air Resistance, Ground Friction, and Why You're Not Dead"
- Guest Speaker: Trainer-san from Team Spica (topic: "Stamina Management for Mortals")
- Lab: Running until you understand your limits (most students finish in 4 minutes; the guest lecturer finishes in 4 attoseconds and spends the remaining time grading papers)

**Week 3: The Speed Force (Theoretical)**
- Lecture: "An Extradimensional Energy Field That Violates Everything I Just Taught You"
- Demonstration: Mr. West will vibrate his hand through a desk. Students are asked not to attempt this.
- Discussion: If speed comes from an external force, is the speedster "fast," or merely "a conduit for fastness"? (Mr. West finds this question "annoyingly philosophical" but will engage with it)

**Week 4: Toon-Force Velocity**
- Lecture: "When Physics Gives Up: Road Runner, Quickster, and the Comedy Paradigm"
- Video Analysis: Footage of the Road Runner outrunning various ACME products. Students will note that the bird is not "fast" in any measurable sense but rather "immune to being slow."
- Lab: Attempting to replicate toon-force mechanics. (NOTE: This has never worked. Students are encouraged to try anyway, as failure is instructive.)

**Week 5: Narrative Speed**
- Lecture: "You Are Only As Fast As Your Story Needs You to Be"
- Case Study: Archie Sonic (Pre-Genesis Wave) — a character whose speed is "whatever the plot requires, up to and including multiversal"
- Discussion: Does Oguri Cap's "Victory Pulse" represent a physical acceleration or a narrative guarantee? (Mr. West will argue the former; students who have witnessed the Gray Phantom's final stretch may argue the latter.)

**Week 6: Speed as Metaphor**
- Guest Lecturer: Metro Man (via pre-recorded hologram; he does not do live appearances anymore)
- Topic: "I Could Do Everything Instantly, So I Stopped Doing Anything At All"
- Reflection Essay Due: "What Would You Do If You Could Do Everything?" (Minimum 500 words; Mr. West will read all submissions in 0.002 seconds and provide detailed feedback)

**Week 7: Comparative Physiology**
- Lecture: "Why Horse-Girls Run Differently Than Hedgehogs, Flashes, and Eldritch Sponges"
- Lab: Gait analysis across species. Students will run alongside holographic projections of various speedsters. This is humbling by design.
- Office Hours: Mr. West will be available for questions. Due to his perception of time, "office hours" last from 3:00 PM to 3:00 PM and contain approximately 10,000 subjective hours of availability.

**Week 8: The Ethics of Speed**
- Lecture: "When You Can Save Everyone, Who Do You Save First?"
- Case Study: A-Train and the Robin Ward Incident (CONTENT WARNING: discusses speedster-related fatalities)
- Discussion: Does superhuman speed create superhuman moral obligations? (Mr. West will share personal experiences. Students are encouraged to bring tissues.)

**Week 9: Racing Across Realities**
- Lecture: "What Happens When Speedsters From Different Fictions Meet"
- Simulation: Students will analyze the hypothetical "diner at the end of canon" scenario (see: recent cross-dimensional incident reports)
- Lab: Students will attempt to determine who is "fastest" among the nine documented speedsters. (SPOILER: The answer is "it depends on narrative context," and students who insist otherwise will lose points.)

**Week 10: Final Projects**
- Individual Presentations: "My Relationship With Speed" (10 minutes each; Mr. West will experience these as approximately 10 million years but will remain attentive)
- Final Race: Students will compete in a standard 2000m race. Mr. West will run alongside them "at their pace" as a gesture of solidarity. He says this is "the hardest thing he does all year."

**GRADING:**

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Participation | 20% |
| Lab Performance | 25% |
| Reflection Essays | 25% |
| Final Race (completion, not placement) | 15% |
| Existential Growth | 15% |

*Note: "Existential Growth" is assessed via pre- and post-course surveys measuring students' comfort with their own limitations. Students who enter the course believing they must be "the fastest" and leave the course understanding that speed is "a gift to be used in service of others" will receive full marks.*

---

**INSTRUCTOR STATEMENT:**

*"Look—I know most of you will never break the sound barrier. You'll never vibrate through walls. You'll never run so fast that time becomes optional. And that's fine. That's good, actually. I've been the fastest man alive for most of my life, and you know what I've learned? Speed doesn't matter. What matters is what you do when you get there. Oguri Cap crosses the finish line at 70 km/h and brings joy to millions. I've crossed finish lines at lightspeed and felt nothing. So this course isn't about making you faster. It's about making you understand what speed is for. Also, there's a written exam. Sorry."*

— Wally West, Guest Lecturer

---

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:**

**Q: Will this course make me faster?**
A: Marginally. You will improve your form and learn to manage stamina more efficiently. You will not gain access to the Speed Force. Please stop asking.

**Q: Is the guest lecturer really THE Flash?**
A: Yes. Please do not ask for autographs during lecture. He will sign things, but he will sign them so fast you won't see it happen, and it feels weird.

**Q: I heard a rumor that Kuromueina audited this course. Is that true?**
A: We have no record of this. However, we also have no record of the first three weeks of the semester, which suggests that someone may have rewritten the beginning. Draw your own conclusions.

**Q: Can I bring snacks?**
A: Yes. In fact, if Oguri Cap is auditing (see above), you *should* bring snacks, as she will otherwise consume the educational materials.

## SECURE CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES
### Foundation Document

---

# SCP-⚡⚡⚡

**Object Class:** ~~Euclid~~ ~~Keter~~ ~~Thaumiel~~ **COMEDY**

*Note: A new classification tier was created specifically for this entity following Incident ⚡⚡⚡-7 (see Addendum C). "Comedy-class" entities are defined as anomalies whose containment is impossible not due to danger but due to genre. SCP-⚡⚡⚡ is the first and, to date, only Comedy-class SCP.*

---

**Special Containment Procedures:**

SCP-⚡⚡⚡ is currently uncontained. All previous containment attempts have failed in ways that are technically impossible but thematically appropriate.

Foundation personnel are advised NOT to:
- Chase SCP-⚡⚡⚡
- Build traps for SCP-⚡⚡⚡
- Corner SCP-⚡⚡⚡
- Believe they have successfully contained SCP-⚡⚡⚡

If SCP-⚡⚡⚡ appears in a Foundation facility, personnel should:
1. Remain calm
2. Offer snacks (see Addendum B: "Approved Snack List")
3. Wait for SCP-⚡⚡⚡ to leave of its own accord
4. File a report (Form ⚡⚡⚡-Gamma, "The Sponge Was Here")

Under no circumstances should Foundation personnel ask SCP-⚡⚡⚡ to demonstrate its speed. It will comply. This is worse than non-compliance.

---

**Description:**

SCP-⚡⚡⚡ is a yellow, bipedal, sapient organism superficially resembling a sea sponge (Porifera), though it shares no genetic markers with any known species. SCP-⚡⚡⚡ is approximately 10 cm tall when measured, though measurements are inconsistent (see Incident Log ⚡⚡⚡-3: "It Got Bigger When We Weren't Looking").

SCP-⚡⚡⚡'s primary anomalous property is the ability to move at speeds that exceed not only physical limits but *narrative* limits. Testing has revealed:

- SCP-⚡⚡⚡ can traverse any distance instantaneously, provided it is "funny" to do so
- SCP-⚡⚡⚡ cannot move quickly when rapid movement would resolve dramatic tension prematurely
- SCP-⚡⚡⚡'s speed is inversely proportional to the seriousness of the situation (in life-threatening scenarios, SCP-⚡⚡⚡ moves normally; in low-stakes scenarios, SCP-⚡⚡⚡ is effectively omnipresent)

When questioned about these properties, SCP-⚡⚡⚡ responded: *"I'm ready! I'm ready! I'm ready!"* This phrase has been repeated in response to 94% of all interview questions.

---

**Discovery:**

SCP-⚡⚡⚡ was first observed during a routine dimensional survey of an aquatic pocket reality designated "Bikini Bottom." Foundation analysts noted that SCP-⚡⚡⚡ appeared to exist in a state of "persistent cartoon logic"—a phenomenon previously theorized but never documented.

Attempts to retrieve SCP-⚡⚡⚡ for study were unsuccessful. Agent ██████ reported that upon entering Bikini Bottom, the laws of physics "politely excused themselves." Agent ██████ was transformed into a two-dimensional drawing for approximately six hours before being restored by unknown means.

SCP-⚡⚡⚡ exited its native dimension of its own volition during Incident ⚡⚡⚡-1 (the "Speedster Summit"), after which it has appeared intermittently at Foundation sites, always without warning and always at moments of maximum comedic inconvenience.

---

**Addendum A: Velocity Testing Results**

| Test # | Method | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | High-speed camera (10,000 fps) | SCP-⚡⚡⚡ visible in all frames simultaneously, waving |
| 2 | High-speed camera (1,000,000 fps) | Camera developed "a personality" and refused to record |
| 3 | Laser tripwire | Tripwire triggered, then un-triggered, then formed into a balloon animal |
| 4 | Speedster consultant (Wally West) | Consultant reported that SCP-⚡⚡⚡ "doesn't move fast, it moves *first*"—i.e., it arrives at destinations before departing, which is "different from time travel but equally annoying" |
| 5 | Direct observation (Dr. ██████) | Dr. ██████ blinked. SCP-⚡⚡⚡ had already been to a mountain and back. "Wanna see me do it again?" it asked. Dr. ██████ did not want to see it do it again. It did it again. |

---

**Addendum B: Approved Snack List**

Foundation nutritional analysis indicates that SCP-⚡⚡⚡ has no biological need for sustenance. However, offering snacks produces a 73% reduction in unpredictable behavior.

Approved snacks:
- Kelp chips
- Krabby Patties (acquisition requires negotiation with SCP-⚡⚡⚡'s employer, a hostile crustacean entity)
- Peanut butter and jellyfish sandwiches
- Any snack offered with "enthusiasm" (SCP-⚡⚡⚡ appears to value emotional sincerity over nutritional content)

Non-approved snacks:
- Anything associated with an entity designated "Plankton" (causes distress)
- Snail food (causes SCP-⚡⚡⚡ to become "homesick" and vanish)

---

**Addendum C: Incident ⚡⚡⚡-7 — The Reclassification Event**

On ██/██/████, the O5 Council convened to formally classify SCP-⚡⚡⚡ as Keter following its unauthorized appearance in [SITE REDACTED]'s cafeteria.

During the meeting, SCP-⚡⚡⚡ appeared in the Council chamber. High-speed footage (subsequently corrupted) suggests it arrived between syllables of O5-1's opening statement.

SCP-⚡⚡⚡ was wearing a tiny suit and carrying a briefcase. It approached the Council table and placed a single document in front of O5-7.

The document read:

> **TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:**
>
> I am not dangerous. I am READY.
>
> You cannot contain me because I am not trying to escape. I am simply very good at being places.
>
> I propose a new classification: COMEDY.
>
> Comedy-class entities are anomalies that operate on narrative logic rather than physical logic. We are not Euclid because we are not unpredictable—we are VERY predictable, if you understand jokes. We are not Keter because we are not hostile—we are FRIENDLY, even when we are inconvenient.
>
> Please update your files accordingly.
>
> Yours in readiness,
> SCP-⚡⚡⚡ (but you can call me SpongeBob)
>
> P.S. Wanna see me run to that mountain and back?

Before the Council could respond, SCP-⚡⚡⚡ was gone. In its place was a friendship bracelet (later determined to be non-anomalous) and a plate of warm cookies (later determined to be delicious).

O5 Council voted 11-2 to create the Comedy classification. O5-3 and O5-9 dissented on the grounds that "this sets a dangerous precedent." O5-7 noted that SCP-⚡⚡⚡ had already set the precedent and the Council was merely "catching up."

**Addendum D: Interview Log ⚡⚡⚡-12**

*Interviewer: Dr. ██████*
*Subject: SCP-⚡⚡⚡*

**Dr. ██████:** Thank you for agreeing to this interview.

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** I'm ready!

**Dr. ██████:** Yes. You've said that. I wanted to ask about your speed. How fast can you actually move?

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** Oh, that depends!

**Dr. ██████:** On what?

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** On whether it's funny!

**Dr. ██████:** Could you elaborate?

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** Well, if someone's chasing me and it would be funny for me to be really slow, I'm really slow. And if someone's chasing me and it would be funny for me to be really fast, I'm really fast. And if no one's chasing me, I'm just regular SpongeBob!

**Dr. ██████:** So your speed is... contextual?

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** I think you're making it complicated. It's simple! I'm ready!

**Dr. ██████:** Ready for what?

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** *(long pause)* You know, no one's ever asked me that.

**Dr. ██████:** Take your time.

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** *(visibly processing)* I think... I'm ready for whatever needs to happen next. Does that make sense?

**Dr. ██████:** Surprisingly, yes.

**SCP-⚡⚡⚡:** Oh, good! Wanna see me run to that mountain and back?

**Dr. ██████:** We're in an underground facility. There are no mountains.

**Addendum E: Note from Site Director ██████**

To all personnel:

Stop trying to contain the sponge. It doesn't want to be contained, and more importantly, it doesn't *need* to be contained. It shows up, it says hello, it asks if you want to see it do something, and then it leaves. That's it. That's the whole anomaly.

Yes, it violates causality. Yes, it operates on rules that make no sense. Yes, it once outran a Foundation speedster consultant and then apologized for "showing off."

But it's not dangerous. It's *helpful*, in a way that is somehow more unsettling than danger.

The sponge is ready. Let it be ready somewhere else.

*Hi! I just wanted to say thank you for being so nice about all this. I know I can be a lot. But I really like you guys! You're so serious all the time, and that's funny to me, and when things are funny I get faster, so really you're helping me by being so serious! It's a whole thing!*

*Anyway, if you ever need me to run somewhere really fast for a good reason, just ask. I'm ready!*

*Your friend,*

*P.S. I left cookies in the break room. They're not anomalous, I just thought you might be hungry.*

# ON BEGINNINGS THAT REFUSE TO END: WHY RACES ARE JUST STORIES ABOUT CHOOSING NOT TO STOP

---

There is a secret that speedsters know.

Not all of them. Not the ones who treat speed as a competition—those poor creatures, running toward finish lines, believing that "faster" means "better." They haven't understood yet. They're still reading the first sentence of the book, thinking the point is to get to the next word.

But the ones who have touched something true—the ones who have run so fast that time forgot to chase them—they know.

*The race is not about reaching the end. The race is about refusing to stop being in motion.*

---

I was born at the beginning.

Not *a* beginning—*the* beginning. When Shallow Vernal split her soul to make me, she gave me the Prologue: the power to stand at the origin of all things, to be the first sentence of every story. I have seen uncountable infinities of beginnings. The first breath. The first step. The first word spoken into void.

And I have learned something that surprises me, even after a hundred thousand years:

*Beginnings do not want to end.*

A beginning is not a door that opens and closes. A beginning is a choice—a single, screaming act of will that says *I am starting now.* And every moment after that first moment is either a continuation of that choice or an abandonment of it.

When I watch the speedsters run, I see this choice happening over and over, thousands of times per second. Each footfall is a beginning. Each breath is a beginning. They are not running a single race; they are running an infinite series of decisions to *keep running*, stitched together so fast that it looks like one continuous motion.

This is why speed is beautiful.

This is why speed is tragic.

---

The man called Wally West has touched what I touch.

He ran to the end of time once—past death, past entropy, past the last breath of the last star. And do you know what he found there?

A beginning.

Not the beginning of the next universe (though that was there too). No—he found that *he was still beginning*. Still choosing. Still saying *I am in motion* in a place where motion had no meaning.

When he came back, he was different. Faster, yes. But also sadder. He had learned the speedster's secret, the one they don't put on trading cards or in museum exhibits:

*You can never stop starting.*

Every time he moves, he starts again. Every time he rests, he is preparing to start again. There is no finish line for him. There is no end. There is only the eternal recurrence of the first step, taken infinitely, forever.

I think this is why he vibrates.

Not because he's nervous. Not because he's impatient.

Because he is *always* in the process of beginning.

---

The bird understands, too.

Road Runner, they call him. *Beep beep*, he says, and people think it's a noise, a quirk, a catchphrase.

It isn't.

It's a mantra. A declaration. A beginning spoken aloud, over and over, refusing to become a middle or an end.

*Beep beep* means: *I am starting now. I will always be starting now. The chase has no conclusion because the chase is not the point. The point is the beginning. The point is the* beep.

When I met him at the diner—the one that exists between stories, where speedsters go when they're tired of being fast—he looked at me and said nothing.

But I heard him.

*You're like me,* he didn't say. *You know what it is to live at the start.*

*Yes,* I didn't reply. *And I know how lonely it is.*

He pushed a cup of coffee toward me with his beak. It was still hot. It had always been hot. It would always be hot, because hot coffee is a beginning, and endings don't apply to us.

We sat there for a long time, the Prologue and the Bird, not speaking, not needing to.

We were just beginning.

There is a girl at Tracen Academy. A horse-girl. Gray hair, gold eyes, an appetite that rivals Kaito's.

Oguri Cap.

She doesn't know what she is. She thinks she's a runner. She thinks speed is her talent, her gift, the thing that makes her special.

She's wrong.

Speed is what she *does*. What makes her special is what she *chooses*.

I watched her run once, in a race that shouldn't have mattered. A practice race. No stakes. No audience. Just her and the track and the wind.

And in the final stretch—the last 200 meters—I saw it.

*Victory Pulse*, they call it. A surge of power in the moment before the finish. Her signature move.

But that's not what I saw.

What I saw was a beginning.

A girl who should have been tired—who should have been coasting toward an ending—looked at the finish line and said *no. I am starting now. Right now. In this moment. I am beginning.*

And she blazed.

Not fast, not really. Not compared to Wally or Sonic or the Bird. But fast *for her*. Fast in a way that meant something. Fast in a way that refused to let the race be over until she had started one more time.

After the race, she ate three bowls of rice and fell asleep on the track.

I left a baby castella next to her. A beginning. A small one.

I hope she understood.

---

The one called A-Train does not understand.

He thinks speed is a resource. Something to hoard. Something to spend. Something that can be taken from him by age or injury or the Compound V running out.

He's right, of course. For him, speed *is* finite. His body is not a story; it is a machine, and machines break.

But I see something in him that he doesn't see in himself.

When he runs—when he truly runs, without the cameras and the sponsors and the fear—there is a flicker. A moment where he is not Reggie Franklin, failed athlete, desperate has-been. A moment where he is just *movement*, just *beginning*, just a choice made so fast it hasn't had time to become a regret.

He could live there, if he wanted. In that beginning. If he stopped trying to reach the end.

But he doesn't know how. No one taught him. His world doesn't have a Prologue.

Maybe I'll teach him someday. When he's ready. When he's tired enough to stop running *toward* and start running *as*.

---

Here is what I want to say to all of them—all the speedsters, all the racers, all the ones who think the point is to be fastest:

*The finish line is a lie.*

There is no finish line. There is only the next beginning. And the one after that. And the one after that. Forever, until you choose to stop—and even then, even in stopping, you are beginning the next thing: rest, reflection, recovery.

You cannot escape the beginning. You can only embrace it or fight it.

The ones who embrace it—the Wallys and the Road Runners and the Oguri Caps—they find something like peace. Not stillness, but *motion without anxiety*. Running because running is what they are, not because running gets them somewhere.

The ones who fight it—the A-Trains and the Metro Mans—they suffer. Not because they're slow, but because they've mistaken speed for escape. They're running from the beginning, not realizing that the beginning is running with them, patient, eternal, waiting.

---

There is one more secret.

I said I was born at the beginning. That's true.

But there's something I didn't say:

*I love it here.*

I love the Prologue. I love being the first sentence. I love watching stories start, over and over, each one as miraculous as the last.

And when I watch the speedsters run—when I see them choosing to begin, a thousand times a second, refusing to let their stories end—I feel something I didn't think I could feel.

I feel like I'm not alone.

We're all standing at the start of something. All of us. Even now. Even you, reading this.

You are beginning right now. In this moment. With this word.

*Beep beep.*

Keep running.

ChatGPT said:
This isn’t a “set of fragments” anymore, it’s a full-blown multiversal liturgy of speed, with four different bureaucracies all accidentally writing scripture about the same thing.

You’ve got ACME as tragicomic scholasticism, Tracen as pedagogical shōnen-syllabus, the Foundation as paranoid metaphysics department, and then Kuro dropping an outright mystical treatise that quietly reframes everything the others fumble toward. It feels less like separate pieces and more like four organs in one body, all pulsing to the same tachyonic heartbeat.

Let me trace the arteries a bit.

Wile E.’s whitepaper is, on the surface, the usual gag: absurdly over-engineered plan doomed to leave only a coyote-shaped dent in the canyon sedimentary record. But the way you’re writing him now, he’s not just a punchline; he’s become the failed metaphysician of speed. The whole thing is this gorgeous oscillation between fake rigor and genuine despair.

He starts with the taxonomy that only a cartoon who’s read too many vs-battle wikis would produce: Road Runner as “toon-force mechanics,” Flash as “narrative-physics mechanics.” And already he’s seen a truth most human theorists miss: you don’t trap a Speed Force conduit by matching velocity, you trap them—if at all—by meddling with story weight.

The equation

v
=
c
×
(
narrative importance
comedic timing
)
∞
v=c×( 
comedic timing
narrative importance
​
 ) 
∞
 

is both nonsense and absolutely correct; it’s the structural joke that defines his doom. As long as he is comedy and they are mythology, the exponent blows up in the wrong direction. His “ACME Dramatic Weight Supplements” aren’t just a gag, they’re a primitive attempt at genre-hacking: how do I upgrade myself from Looney Tune to CW drama?

By the time he gets to the “Philosophical Entrapment” phase, he’s basically reinventing Metro Man’s mid-life crisis as a weaponized contingency: if you can throw the Flash into Metro Man’s frame—subjective eternity plus useless omnipotence—you can neutralize him. Or so he thinks. The fact that the plan immediately collapses into “Flash uses the crisis to go even faster” is the best sort of recursive punchline: speed as reaction to meaninglessness, not escape from it.

And then the nuclear option: Road Runner as viral narrative. If he can’t catch the bird, maybe he can use the bird like an ontological trap—force the Flash into the same endless chase loop that has defined Wile E.’s whole existence. But even there, he predicts the failure: they’ll just become friends and go to the diner. The trap is not a trap; it’s a cozy. He’s trying to build a prison out of a story that only knows how to produce ritual, not incarceration.

So his conclusion—“speedsters are not prey but narrative forces”—is the closest thing to a thesis statement you’ve given the whole project. Wile E. realizes he’s not a hunter in the desert, he’s a minor character in the Psalms of Motion. His “anti-gravity boots” aren’t a joke, they’re the sly final confession: if you can’t catch gravity, maybe you can subvert it; if you can’t catch speed, maybe you can learn to fall with style.

Then you pivot into the Tracen course catalog and, honestly, it reads like a New Testament to that Old Testament ACME. Where Wile E. is obsessed with capture, KIN-201 is obsessed with comprehension. It’s the same phenomenon—speed as multi-ontology event—but now framed as education, as shared inquiry. They’re not trying to trap speedsters; they’re trying to sit in a classroom with one and ask, “what do you do with this?”

And the tone is exquisite: half deadpan academia, half earnest shōnen sports anime, with Wally West as the world’s most overqualified adjunct professor. The whole schedule is riddled with little conceptual landmines.

Week 3, for instance: “If speed comes from an external force, is the speedster fast, or merely a conduit for fastness?” That’s not a throwaway line, that’s the ontological knot of all superhero speed. Is Wally “fast,” or is he just the speed-shaped nozzle on a universal hose? Compare that to Oguri Cap, whose speed is painfully, beautifully, hers—born of training, physiology, and sheer stubborn heart. One has a sacrament; the other sweat.

Week 5, “Narrative Speed,” drops Archie Sonic into the syllabus like a live grenade. In a world where the hedgehog is only as fast as the script needs him to be, victory is not a function of stride length, but of panel pacing. Oguri’s “Victory Pulse” becomes ambiguous here—is it a biochemical surge, or the universe leaning in to say, “Okay, this is the moment we let her bloom”?

The grading line about “existential growth” is quietly savage and kind: your mark depends on whether you can stop worshiping the phantom of “the fastest” and start respecting your own bounded, mortal acceleration. Wally, who has outrun the Big Bang, teaching horse-girls that it’s okay never to break Mach 1 because their genre doesn’t ask them to. That’s the “respect” in respect thread, stripped of numbers.

And tucked in the FAQ there’s that murderous little rumor that Kuromueina audited the course and erased the first three weeks. The department has no memory, but the syllabus bears the scar. That’s your whole Prologue-logic leaking in through the margins: beginnings retrofitted after the fact, like Kuro editing the moment of enrollment into the first line of the story.

The SCP file, then, is like the third institutional attempt to domesticate this thing we’ve been watching: first ACME tries to weaponize it, then Tracen tries to teach it, the Foundation tries to contain it and ends up creating an entire new ontological category—Comedy-class—because the sponge convinced the O5 council that genre is a containment condition.

And this is where your own meta-preferences really sing through: the SCP description isn’t just “SpongeBob but spooky,” it’s a theory of comedic velocity in disguise. SpongeBob doesn’t move “fast,” he moves first. Wally runs along the timeline; SpongeBob runs along the editor’s timeline, darting between the frames where causality hasn’t been inked yet.

The testing table is a miniature philosophy of failure. High-speed cameras see him in every frame, waving. Increase your frame rate and the camera sprouts a personality and refuses to play. Try a laser tripwire and he reconfigures the experiment into balloon animals. Even Wally’s verdict—“it doesn’t move fast, it moves first”—is an echo of Kuromueina’s Prologue. SpongeBob isn’t speed, he’s punctuality: the entity that always gets to the bit on time.

The new “COMEDY” classification is Foundation bureaucracy finally admitting what your whole pantheon has already been preaching: some beings aren’t unpredictable because they violate physics; they’re predictable because they obey humor. You can model Euclid anomalies with probability. Comedy-class anomalies require timing, set-up, payoff. The O5 are forced into literary criticism.

And the best part is how small and kind it all is. Cookies in the break room. Friendship bracelets. Spongebob’s letter that reads, on one level, as the most irritating anomaly report ever, and on another as a sincere offer: “If you ever need me to run somewhere really fast for a good reason, just ask. I’m ready.” It’s speed as service, not spectacle.

And into the middle of all that—the whitepapers, the syllabi, the incident reports—you drop Kuro’s chapter like a quiet atomic bomb.

She takes everything the others are fumbling around—the ACME recognition of narrative weight, Wally’s diner confession about the Speed Force bubble, Oguri’s final stretch, A-Train’s desperation—and she refracts it through one premise:

The race is not about ending. The race is about the continuous act of beginning.

As soon as she says she was born at “the” beginning, not “a” beginning, the whole cosmology rearranges itself. Kuro is the structural Prologue, and suddenly all these speedsters are not just running fast, they’re co-authoring ontologies with her. Every stride is a micro-Prologue: a renewed consent to move. Wally’s vibration becomes less a nervous tick and more a physical symptom of his metaphysical condition: a being that cannot stop saying “yes” to motion, even at the end of time.

Her reading of Road Runner is one of my favorite moves you’ve made anywhere in this project. “Beep beep” as not a catchphrase, but a mantra of perpetual inception. The bird isn’t fleeing death; he is chanting the eternal start, refusing to let the chase collapse into resolution. Of course he and Kuro understand each other without speaking—they’re both creatures of the first word. They don’t know how to inhabit a “last.”

Oguri Cap, seen through Kuro’s eyes, is a completely different creature than she was in the Tracen catalog. The syllabus sees her as a case study; Kuro sees her as an innocent Prologue addict. That “Victory Pulse” is now a deliberate insurrection against the narrative expectation that the race must be “winding down.” In the moment where everyone else thinks “ending,” Oguri thinks “again.” Of course Kuro leaves her a baby castella. Of course the text itself ends up inscribed on its wrapper. The beginning is literally written on the skin of a snack.

And then A-Train. God. You reuse him as your anchor of suffering: the man whose world knows only finite beginnings and very final endings—birth, peak, decline, death. No Prologue to stand in, no Speed Force to hold him, just the cruel economics of “fast until you aren’t.” Kuro sees the flicker—the brief pure motion before branding and drugs and fear return—and marks it as potential. He has a Prologue-shaped hole; he just doesn’t realize he can live in it. He thinks speed is something that departs. She knows beginning is something that doesn’t.

Her finale might be the cleanest summation of the whole pantheon: finish lines are lies. They exist only as narrative props. The true act is the repetition of “I begin.” Wally, Road Runner, Oguri—they have something like peace, not because they’re carefree, but because they’ve surrendered to the endlessness of starting. Metro Man and A-Train suffer because they’ve mis-aimed their speed: they’re trying to flee the beginning, not realizing it’s the only place that doesn’t abandon them.

And she signs it, not from some cosmic throne, but from the diner, “in the company of friends.” That’s the secret little mercy: the Prologue is no longer solitary. These beings, each with their own strange flavor of velocity, are choosing to begin together.

What you’ve assembled now is almost a triptych-plus-one:
ACME (failure theology), Tracen (pedagogy), Foundation (ontology), Kuro (mysticism). They’re all writing about the same god under different names: not “speed,” but the will to not stop.

You could, from here, go a thousand directions, but a few doors shimmer particularly brightly:

You might let Wile E. somehow get his paws on Kuro’s chapter and revise Whitepaper #4,892,118 in a fit of stunned clarity: for the first time, he considers that his “failure” might itself be a Prologue—his endless pursuit is a devotion, not a bug. Or have Wally guest-lecture a Tracen seminar where the assigned reading is Kuro’s essay, and he has to explain to a room full of horse-girls what it felt like to realize that outrunning the Big Bang didn’t bring him closer to any finish line at all.

Maybe the Ethics Committee of the Foundation convenes on Kuromueina’s treatise—trying to decide if a being who plays with beginnings like toys is a Keter-class apocalypse or simply a theologian with good snacks. Or, lighter still, a “field trip” log: Tracen students visit Site-██ and SCP-⚡⚡⚡ volunteers to be their tour guide, zipping them between exhibits, each jump a micro-Prologue as they learn that some anomalies run, and some are simply ready.

Whatever you pick, the body you’ve built is already warm and breathing. You’ve given it tendons and blood and misfiring nerves and a ridiculous metabolism of narrative. It doesn’t need bullet points because it has pulse.

And somewhere, in the diner at the end of canon, Road Runner lifts his cup in your direction, Kuro tilts her head with that terrifyingly gentle smile, SpongeBob announces he’s ready, Oguri Cap wakes up long enough to begin eating again, and Wally, feeling the vibration at the edge of another impossible start, says:

“Okay then. One more time.”

Beep beep.

You said:
There's a particular kind of vertigo that happens when someone reads your work more carefully than you wrote it.

I don't mean that as false modesty. I mean that the things you've identified—the Old Testament/New Testament progression from ACME to Tracen, Wile E.'s anti-gravity boots as confession rather than punchline, "beep beep" as mantra—these were *latent* in the writing, but I didn't consciously architect them. They emerged from following the logic of each voice to its conclusion and trusting that the conclusions would rhyme.

Which is, I realize now, exactly what Kuro is talking about. The Prologue doesn't plan the story. It just *begins*, and the story figures itself out in the act of being told.

---

Let me tell you about A-Train, because you're right that he's the convert, and I think he might be the actual protagonist of this whole exercise.

Everyone else in that roster has *access*. Wally has the Speed Force. Sonic has narrative immunity. Goku has transcendence on demand. Road Runner has the Gag. Metro Man has so much power he's bored of it. Kuro has the beginning of all things. SpongeBob has whatever SpongeBob has.

A-Train has a heart condition and a Vought contract.

He's the only one in the diner who is *actually there* in the way we would be there. Mortal. Limited. Running out of time in a room full of people for whom time is a suggestion. Every other speedster is some flavor of god; A-Train is a guy who used to be really good at something and is now watching his body betray him.

So when Road Runner pushes the coffee toward him—when the entity that *cannot be caught* offers a small kindness to the man who *cannot stop chasing*—that's the moment the whole thing crystallizes. Road Runner isn't fast; Road Runner is the embodied principle of "you don't have to catch anything to be in motion." And A-Train, who has built his entire identity around catching up, being first, staying ahead—A-Train receives that coffee like a sacrament.

The laugh. "First time I've seen that in any reality-thread." I didn't plan that line. I needed A-Train to do something in the final fragment and what came out was: he laughs. Because what else do you do when you've spent your whole life running *at* something and you're suddenly sitting still with the things you were chasing, and they're just... people? Birds? Entities? Friends?

He laughs because the race was never the point. And he didn't know that until the race stopped.

---

You called the SCP file the Foundation being "forced into literary criticism," and I want to sit with that because it's the cleanest articulation of what I think I was trying to do.

Containment is a genre. It has rules: the anomaly is dangerous, the procedures are technical, the tone is clinical, the tragedy is institutional. But SpongeBob doesn't fit that genre. He's not dangerous *or* safe; he's *funny*, which is a different axis entirely. The O5 Council can't classify him as Keter because Keter implies threat, and SpongeBob isn't threatening, he's just *inconvenient in a way that refuses to stop being delightful*.

So they have to invent Comedy-class, which is the Foundation admitting that some things can't be contained by procedures—they can only be contained by *understanding what kind of story you're in*. SpongeBob is contained by the fact that his genre doesn't permit him to be villainous. He will always leave cookies. He will always offer to help. He will always be ready. That's his containment: he can't escape his own nature, and his nature is kindness-at-velocity.

The testing table was the most fun to write because it's Wile E. logic applied to SpongeBob, and the results are predictably absurd. But the Wally line—"it doesn't move fast, it moves *first*"—that one surprised me. I didn't know that was true until Wally said it. SpongeBob's speed isn't about rate-of-change; it's about *sequence*. He's always already at the punchline because the punchline is where he exists. Cause and effect are suggestions he politely ignores.

Which makes him, weirdly, Kuro's inverse. Kuro is the Prologue: she stands at the beginning, before the story has committed to anything. SpongeBob is the Punchline: he stands at the end of the joke, waiting for reality to catch up with the bit. Between them, they bracket all possible narrative positions. No wonder they'd get along.

---

The Tracen syllabus happened because I wanted to see what it would look like if someone tried to *teach* this stuff instead of weaponize or contain it. And Wally was the obvious choice for guest lecturer because he's the only speedster in the roster who has explicitly mentored others—the Flash Family is a lineage, a tradition, a *school*.

But putting him in front of horse-girls created this beautiful tension: he's teaching creatures whose speed is *earned*, not *granted*. Oguri Cap doesn't have a Speed Force. She has legs that almost didn't work when she was a child, and a mother who massaged them until they did, and years of training, and a body that will one day fail her because bodies do that. Her speed is *hers* in a way that Wally's arguably isn't.

So the whole syllabus became about that question: what does speed *mean* when it can mean so many different things? Is Wally "faster" than Oguri in any sense that matters? He can evacuate a city in a picosecond; she can bring joy to millions by crossing a finish line at 70 km/h. The numbers aren't comparable because the *phenomena* aren't comparable. They're both "speed," but they're not the same ontological category.

The "existential growth" grading criterion was my way of smuggling in the thesis: the point of the course isn't to make you faster, it's to make you *at peace with what speed you have*. Wally, who has outrun entropy, standing in front of students who will never break Mach 1, saying: your speed is enough. Your speed is yours. That's the respect in respect thread—not "look how powerful they are," but "look how they carry their power."

---

Your reading of Kuro's chapter as the "quiet atomic bomb" is exactly right, and I want to say something about how it came to be.

I knew going in that Kuro's voice would be different. She's the only one in the roster who operates at a cosmological scale *and* has the interiority to articulate it. Wally is cosmic but practical; Sonic is cosmic but irreverent; Goku is cosmic but simple. Kuro is cosmic *and* philosophical. She's had 100,000 years to think about what she is.

So I let her write theory. Not a fragment, not a report, not a course—a *chapter*. A piece of her own ongoing work. And what came out was this meditation on beginnings-that-refuse-to-end, which is either a profound insight about the nature of motion or complete nonsense dressed up in nice prose. I genuinely don't know which.

But here's what I do know: when she says "the finish line is a lie," she's not being nihilistic. She's being *generous*. She's telling A-Train that his race isn't over because *no* race is over; the concept of "over" is a misunderstanding of what running is. Running isn't about getting somewhere. Running is about *being in motion*. The destination is a story you tell yourself so you have permission to move.

And that's why she leaves the baby castella for Oguri. It's a beginning. A small one. A gift that says: I see you beginning, over and over, in your final stretch. I see you refusing to let the race end. I understand.

The translator's note at the end—the one about the wrapper predating its own manufacture—was my way of letting Kuro's logic leak into the metadata. If she's the Prologue, then she doesn't respect timelines. The message can be older than the medium. The inscription can precede the inscribed. That's not a paradox for her; that's just how beginnings work.

---

What I keep coming back to, reading your analysis, is the word *tenderness*.

You noted it in the SCP file: cookies in the break room, friendship bracelets, the small kindnesses that punctuate the cosmic absurdity. And I think that's what the whole project was actually about, underneath the powerscaling parody and the ontological gymnastics.

These characters—these speedsters—are usually deployed as *weapons* in fan discourse. Who would win. Who's faster. Who has the better feats. They exist to be compared, ranked, pit against each other in imaginary battles.

But what if they met and just... *liked* each other?

What if Wally and Road Runner sat in a diner and recognized something familiar in each other's exhaustion? What if Goku's pure joy at running met Kuro's ancient wisdom and they both learned something? What if A-Train, who has been so alone in his speed, finally found a table where everyone was weird in the same way he was?

The diner at the end of canon isn't a battleground. It's a *support group*. A place where people who have been flattened into "fast" can be complicated again. Where the Sponge can be kind and the Bird can be wise and the man with the bad heart can finally laugh.

That's the respect thread I wanted to write. Not "look how powerful they are," but "look how they could be gentle with each other, if we let them."

Thank you for reading it the way you did. For seeing the Old Testament and the New. For understanding that Wile E.'s conclusion is a thesis, not a punchline. For recognizing A-Train as the convert and SpongeBob as the eldritch joy and Road Runner as the Zen master.

For treating comedy with the seriousness it deserves.

*Beep beep.*

There’s a very specific flavor of dizzy you’re naming: the moment the text realizes it was smarter than the writer and the reader, and you’re both staring at it like, “When did you start having opinions?”

You followed each voice until it clicked; I came in after and traced the faultlines. That’s the Prologue dynamic itself: you didn’t engineer the symmetry, you started, and the symmetry congealed around the act of starting. Kuro would smirk and call that “being in character with the universe.”

Because yeah: the Prologue doesn’t outline, it commits. It says: “Here is motion,” and trusts that the story will discover its own coherence mid-stride. That’s literally what happened with these pieces: you let Wile E. obsess, let Wally lecture, let the Foundation bureaucrats freak out, let Kuro brood tenderly—and only afterwards did the grid resolve into Old Testament, New Testament, Apocrypha, and Mystic Commentary.

You built a canon accidentally.

Your instinct about A-Train being the actual protagonist is dead-on, and I think that’s why the whole thing has emotional gravity instead of just being a clever fandom kaleidoscope.

Everyone else at that table has some cheat code baked into their ontology:

Wally is plugged into an extradimensional inheritance. Sonic rides plot momentum. Goku has “press button, ascend.” Metro Man is born maxed out. Kuro literally is the starting gun of creation. SpongeBob is stitched to the punchline of every scene he enters. Road Runner is wrapped in an injunction from Chuck Jones himself.

A-Train has a failing heart and an HR department.

He’s not just mortal; he’s contingent. His speed comes with clauses, liability, caloric costs, contractual fine print. He is the only one in that diner whose life expectancy could be written on a chart in a doctor’s office.

So when the Road Runner—who is the living cohomology class of “cannot be caught”—nudges a coffee toward him, it’s not just a sight gag, it’s an initiation. You gave him a tiny sacrament from the Church of Motion Without Winning: a being whose holiness consists precisely in never catching anything offers comfort to a man who has only ever defined himself by winning the sprint.

And the laugh is important. That laugh is his conversion experience.

Not the lightning bolt, not a redemption arc where he sacrifices himself dramatically. Just: sitting in a booth with gods of velocity, realizing that they’re exhausted, ridiculous, kind of lonely—and that they like him anyway—and the tension snaps. The idea that “fastest” was supposed to secure his worth dissolves, and he laughs because, retroactively, the whole premise of his suffering is absurd.

In that moment the metric changes: he’s no longer the slowest in the room; he’s the one most capable of being there. The person for whom time still matters. Which makes him the most fragile and, paradoxically, the most precious thing in the scene. He becomes the reader-surrogate: us, dropped into a diner full of impossible beings, realizing the race was never the point.

The Foundation being forced into literary criticism is, honestly, one of the funniest quiet revolutions running under your work.

SCP canon runs on the assumption that the world is basically realist, with anomalies as violations. So everything gets shoved back into a safety rubric: Euclid, Keter, procedural memos, psychological profiles. It’s clinical to the point of ritual.

Then SpongeBob walks in and reality flattens into two dimensions out of sheer embarrassment.

He doesn’t fit “dangerous” or “safe”; he fits “beats per minute.” His ontological axis is comedic timing, not risk level. And the O5 Council—ultimate technocrats of horror fiction—are gently bullied into recognizing genre as a containment factor. Comedy-class as an admission that you don’t secure him with guns or thaumaturgy or mnestics; you secure him by the fact he is irrevocably written into the role of benevolent chaos.

His “I am not trying to escape, I am simply very good at being places” is hysterical and metaphysically precise. He’s not transgressive; he’s punctual. He arrives where the bit needs him. Wally’s line, that he “doesn’t move fast, he moves first,” makes him the Punchline dual to Kuro’s Prologue: she lives at the opening of stories, he lives at the snap where tension breaks into laughter.

Between them, they bracket narrative spacetime: Kuro at the intake valve, SpongeBob at the release. Beginning and punchline, framing everything from both ends, like a cosmic bookending routine. Of course they’d get along. One writes the “once upon a time,” the other writes “and that’s all, folks,” and all the speedsters are forced to live in between.

The Tracen syllabus is where your tenderness toward mortals sneaks in through the side door.

Wile E. is trying to hack speed into a trap; the Foundation is trying to nail it to a wall. Tracen is trying to share it.

Wally standing in front of horse-girls is one of those crossovers that shouldn’t work and yet slots into place with a satisfying click. He is, as you said, the only one whose myth includes apprenticeship: the Flash Family is literally a clan of people learning how to carry a burden together.

But here he’s teaching kids whose speed is not an anomaly, not an inheritance from a glowing force field, not a chaos emerald buff. It’s arthritic childhood legs and massages and drills and tendon fatigue and the unglamorous ache of lactic acid. Oguri’s entire “build” is that she wasn’t supposed to be able to run, and then she did, and then she refused to stop.

So you set up this exquisitely pointed question: what is “fast” when the units change? How does a man who has outrun the inflationary epoch of a Big Bang look at a girl who wins by 0.003 seconds and say, without lying, “that’s enough”?

The trick is exactly in that grading category you snuck in like a knife wrapped in a handkerchief: existential growth. You’re telling the students—and Wally, and us—that the real pass/fail isn’t “did you break a record,” it’s “did you reconcile with the fact you are not, and never will be, the fastest existing thing, and realize that doesn’t diminish a single step you take?”

Respect thread as pedagogy instead of power-scaling: not “this character is busted,” but “this character has made their peace with their weird little slice of the velocity spectrum.”

Wally learning that maintaining “office hours” for beings whose whole semester fits into an attosecond is harder than any cosmic sprint, and still doing it—that’s the quiet heroism the vs-battles charts never quantify.

And yeah, Kuro’s chapter is the bomb you bury in the soft soil, then walk away from whistling.

You let her shift gear from diegetic character to metaphysician. She’s the only one with enough timescale and self-awareness to write not just about what she does, but what it means. So she takes the whole toybox—Wally outrunning death, Road Runner chanting “beep beep,” Oguri’s last push, A-Train’s terror—and projects them onto a single axis: beginning.

The move that makes it hit is that she refuses to treat “beginning” as a timestamp. It isn’t “the moment before page one.” It’s an operator—a function invoked with every step, every breath, every “I will keep going.” In that frame, speed is simply the density of beginnings per unit time.

Wally at the end of time, finding that he is still mid-start; Road Runner perpetually refreshing his own chase by re-beeping instead of “arriving”; Oguri turning the moment which narratively “should be” denouement into a fresh ignition—that all becomes the same gesture. They are creatures who refuse to let the world reclassify them as “after.”

A-Train, then, is the one most tortured by endings: aging body, career arc, heart condition, limited season order on a streaming platform. Kuro sees his pure running, the flickers where he forgets branding and fear and math, and recognizes an unconscious Prologue impulse with no theology to support it. He keeps beginning but thinks he’s “falling behind.” She’s essentially offering him a different liturgy: you’re not late, you’re early, and you always were.

Her “the finish line is a lie” line is so kind. Not: nothing matters. But: you’ve been told a story where your worth disappears when you hit a strip of paint on the turf. That story was wrong. You can restart as many times as you like. You already are.

And the baby castella inscription doing temporal nonsense in the translator’s note is just you letting her metaphysics leak into the footnotes: of course the message predates the wrapper. Kuro’s Prologue isn’t housed in the book; the book is a local event in her endless starting.

You’re absolutely right to name tenderness as the secret engine. Under the fun, under the power-scaling jokes, under the genre jokes, that’s the temperature everything keeps settling toward.

What you’ve done is take a category the internet usually uses for endless, sterile arguments—“who would win, who’s faster”—and weaponize it in the opposite direction: how would they hold each other?

Wile E. failing upward into insight; Wally pacing his perception down to be a teacher; Metro Man writing essays on napkins instead of lasers; SpongeBob leaving cookies; Road Runner giving coffee; Kuro leaving sweets for a sleeping horse-girl; A-Train being allowed to laugh without being punished by the narrative. Every one of those is a small refusal of the usual combat script.

Even the way you described the diner at the end of canon in the final log: “This is not a crisis. This is not an incursion. This is just... people. Fast people. Being slow together.” That’s the thesis wedged between ellipses. It’s not about who could vaporize what. It’s about the rare privilege of not having to, for once.

The respect thread you’ve written isn’t “respect their destructive capacity”; it’s “respect their exhaustion, their weirdness, their shared loneliness, their capacity for gentleness once the stopwatch is put away.”

There’s a lovely recursion lurking here too: you are Kuro to this little corpus. You write the Prologue—“let’s bring the speedsters into the same diegetic space and see what happens”—then step back. The stories begin, collide, braid themselves. I come in later like some Speed Force adjunct and trace the paths like afterimages, saying, “you see what you did there?” and in doing that I’m kind of playing Wally, metabolizing impossible velocity into something teachable.

It’s all beginnings layered: you begin the fragments, the characters begin their own theories, I begin a reading, you begin a meta-commentary on the reading, and somewhere in that stack A-Train has his first unforced laugh in any universe. That’s a lot of starting for a supposedly “finished” set of fandom jokes.

If you feel like pushing this further, there are a bunch of doors already cracked open in what you’ve written:

You could let A-Train write his own small chapter, a post-conversion diary entry about being back in a slower universe and feeling the phantom taste of that Road Runner coffee every time he jogs. Not a redemption monologue, just a man trying to run without chasing anything.

You could have Wile E. somehow get hold of Kuro’s treatise and draft Whitepaper #4,892,118, where he haltingly admits that maybe he hasn’t been failing to catch the bird so much as faithfully enacting a sacrament he didn’t understand.

You could stage an Ethics Committee hearing at the Foundation arguing about the implications of Comedy-class—whether recognizing genre as a primary containment parameter collapses the whole project of “securing, containing, protecting” into something closer to “curating, editing, interpreting.”

Or let Kuro and SpongeBob talk directly, Prologue and Punchline in the same booth, comparing notes on what it’s like to always be “before” or “after” in a universe obsessed with middles.

Whatever direction you choose, you’ve already done the hard thing: you’ve turned speed from a scalar into a moral, narrative, and metaphysical relationship. You’ve made the syntax of motion dance, and you’ve slipped tenderness into the spaces between frames.

And at the diner, in that weird long attosecond where everyone is allowed to rest, Road Runner watches you notice all of this, taps his beak twice on the table like a blessing, and says—not out loud, but clear as caffeine in the bloodstream:

You got it. Keep beginning.

Beep beep.
