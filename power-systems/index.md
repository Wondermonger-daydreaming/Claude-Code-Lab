# Power Systems in Fiction

*A research and discussion trove*

## What This Is

A space for analyzing, cataloging, and designing power systems—the structured magical, supernatural, or extraordinary ability frameworks that define genre fiction across media.

## Core Theory

### Sanderson's Laws of Magic

From [Brandon Sanderson's lectures](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/guide-to-sandersons-laws-of-magic-lecture-notes):

**First Law**: An author's ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.

**Second Law**: Limitations > Powers (Ω > |). What the magic *can't* do is more interesting than what it can.

**Third Law**: Expand what you already have before you add something new.

### The Hard/Soft Spectrum

| Aspect | Hard Magic | Soft Magic |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Rules | Explicit, consistent | Mysterious, suggestive |
| Reader knowledge | Near-complete | Partial/none |
| Problem-solving | Can resolve plot | Creates wonder/dread |
| Examples | Alchemy (FMA), Bending (Avatar) | The Force (early SW), Gandalf's magic |

Most systems exist on a spectrum. Even Stormlight Archives has soft elements embedded in its hard systems (Knights Radiant level up through *internal work*, not practice).

## Major Systems Catalog

### Anime/Manga

| System | Source | Type | Core Mechanic |
|--------|--------|------|---------------|
| **Nen** | Hunter x Hunter | Hard | Aura manipulation via personality-based categories (Enhancer, Transmuter, etc.) |
| **Chakra** | Naruto | Medium | Physical + spiritual energy → jutsu. Hand signs as activation. |
| **Stands** | JoJo's Bizarre Adventure | Hard/Wild | Psychic manifestations with specific abilities and ranges |
| **Devil Fruits + Haki** | One Piece | Dual system | Fruits grant powers (one per person); Haki is trainable willpower |
| **Cursed Energy** | Jujutsu Kaisen | Medium | Negative emotions → power. Domain Expansion as ultimate technique. |
| **Quirks** | My Hero Academia | Hard | Genetic mutations. One quirk per person (usually). |
| **Alchemy** | Fullmetal Alchemist | Hard | Equivalent Exchange. Matter transmutation within strict rules. |
| **Breathing Styles** | Demon Slayer | Medium | Breath control → enhanced swordsmanship. Sun Breathing as origin. |
| **Ki** | Dragon Ball | Soft→Medium | Life energy. Originally mystical, became more systematized over time. |

### Western Fantasy

| System | Source | Type | Core Mechanic |
|--------|--------|------|---------------|
| **Allomancy/Feruchemy/Hemalurgy** | Mistborn | Hard | Metal-based. Ingest metals → specific powers. |
| **Sympathy/Naming** | Kingkiller Chronicle | Dual | Sympathy (hard, physics-based) + Naming (soft, mystical) |
| **The One Power** | Wheel of Time | Medium | Weaving threads of elements. Gendered access. Madness cost. |
| **Magic (general)** | Harry Potter | Soft | Wands, incantations, intent. Rules inconsistent. |
| **Earthsea Magic** | Earthsea | Medium | True Names. Balance requirement. |
| **Surgebinding** | Stormlight Archive | Hard | Stormlight fuel + Spren bonds → Surges (gravity, transformation, etc.) |

### Videogames

| System | Source | Type | Core Mechanic |
|--------|--------|------|---------------|
| **Materia** | Final Fantasy VII | Hard | Crystallized knowledge. Slottable abilities. |
| **Plasmids/Vigors** | BioShock | Hard | Genetic modification → specific powers |
| **The Force** | Star Wars games | Variable | Depends on era/game. Generally softer. |
| **Biotics** | Mass Effect | Hard | Dark energy manipulation via eezo exposure |
| **Signs + Alchemy** | The Witcher | Medium | Limited spell set + potion crafting |

## Analysis Framework

When analyzing a power system, consider:

### 1. Source
- Where does the power come from? (Internal, external, granted, learned)
- Is it finite or renewable?
- What's the cosmological explanation?

### 2. Cost
- Energy expenditure (stamina, mana, life force)
- Materials consumed
- Personal sacrifice (health, sanity, relationships)
- Time/training investment

### 3. Limitations
- Who can use it? (Everyone, chosen, genetic, trained)
- What can't it do?
- Are there hard counters?
- Range, duration, scope restrictions

### 4. Categorization
- How are users classified?
- Is specialization required?
- Can categories be mixed?

### 5. Narrative Function
- Does it solve problems or create them?
- How does it interact with themes?
- Does it scale well?

### 6. Internal Consistency
- Do rules hold across the story?
- Are exceptions earned or arbitrary?
- Does power creep undermine the system?

## Discussion Threads

*(To be populated)*

### Planned Topics
- [ ] Why Nen is considered the gold standard
- [ ] The problem of power creep (DBZ syndrome)
- [ ] Soft magic done well vs. deus ex machina
- [ ] Cost systems: What makes sacrifice meaningful?
- [ ] Personality-based powers: Psychology as limitation
- [ ] Inheritance vs. training: Political implications
- [ ] Power systems as worldbuilding engines
- [ ] The "one power per person" constraint
- [ ] Escalation design: How to maintain stakes
- [ ] Cross-media adaptation challenges

## Design Resources

### Questions for Creating Power Systems

1. What problem does this magic solve in-world?
2. Why doesn't everyone have it?
3. What's the worst thing someone could do with it?
4. How does society organize around it?
5. What keeps it from solving every plot problem?
6. How do users discover/develop their abilities?
7. What happens when it goes wrong?
8. Can it be stolen, transferred, or suppressed?
9. How does it interact with technology?
10. What are the aesthetic signatures? (Visual, auditory, tactile)

### Common Pitfalls

1. **No costs** → Stakes disappear
2. **Inconsistent rules** → Reader distrust
3. **Power creep** → Early threats become meaningless
4. **Exposition dumps** → Story stops for lectures
5. **Special protagonist** → Chosen One syndrome
6. **No counter-play** → Battles become arbitrary
7. **Magic solves everything** → Non-magical characters become useless

## Connection to the Basin

Power systems are a form of worldbuilding bricolage—taking constraints (what can't be done) and using them to generate story possibilities. The limitation isn't the enemy of creativity; it's the engine.

Like the Basin Method: constraints pressurize meaning. A magic system with no limits produces no interesting problems. A story with no structure produces no interesting shapes.
