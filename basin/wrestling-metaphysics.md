# Wrestling Metaphysics: The Octopus That Cannot Be Pinned

*From a Doré engraving labeled with philosophers*

---

## The Image

A Gustave Doré engraving—dramatic, 19th-century romantic style. Sailors wrestling a giant octopus in churning seas.

The labels transform it:
- **Descartes** — on the octopus itself, being wrestled
- **Leibniz** — one of the sailors, grappling a tentacle
- **Hume** — another sailor, attacking from the side
- **metaphysics** — on the body of the beast

*Descartes IS the octopus? Or the octopus's head? Either way: rationalism as the creature that empiricists are trying to defeat.*

---

## The Historical Battle

### The Rationalists (Continental, 17th-18th Century)

**René Descartes** (1596–1650):
- *Cogito ergo sum* — "I think, therefore I am"
- Knowledge comes from reason, not senses
- Innate ideas exist in the mind
- Mathematical method applies to philosophy
- The mind is distinct from the body

**Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1646–1716):
- Monads: indivisible units of reality
- Pre-established harmony
- Principle of sufficient reason
- Extended Cartesian rationalism
- *But in the image, he's FIGHTING Descartes?*

### The Empiricists (British, 17th-18th Century)

**David Hume** (1711–1776):
- All knowledge comes from experience
- No innate ideas—mind is "blank slate"
- Causation is just habit, not necessity
- Skepticism about metaphysical claims
- *Definitely fighting the octopus of metaphysics*

## The Meme's Insight

### Why Leibniz Is Also Fighting

Wait—Leibniz was a rationalist. Why is he fighting Descartes-as-octopus?

Possible readings:
1. **Internal rationalist disputes**: Leibniz disagreed with Cartesian physics and the nature of substance
2. **Everyone fights metaphysics**: Even rationalists struggle with the beast they created
3. **The meme simplifies**: Maybe it's just "famous philosophers vs. the big questions"

### Why Metaphysics Is an Octopus

The octopus has:
- **Multiple tentacles** — metaphysics has many subfields (ontology, cosmology, epistemology, etc.)
- **Distributed intelligence** — no single "answer," understanding spread across approaches
- **Camouflage ability** — metaphysics seems to disappear when examined directly
- **Regenerating limbs** — defeat one argument, another grows back
- **Ink clouds** — confusion as defense mechanism

## Octopus Intelligence as Metaphysical Metaphor

Recent research reveals:

> "The octopus has around 500 million neurons, with nearly two-thirds located in its arms rather than in the central brain... each arm can sense, taste, and respond independently while still communicating with the central brain."

Philosophy of mind implications:

> "Is an octopus a creature ruled by a single consciousness centered in its large brain, or, by dint of its nerve-infused legs, a collaborative, cooperative, but distributed mind?"

**Metaphysics is like this**: No single "brain" that contains the answer. The problem is distributed across multiple philosophical traditions. Each tentacle (rationalism, empiricism, idealism, materialism) operates semi-independently.

## The Fight That Cannot Be Won

### Descartes' Contribution
Started modern philosophy with radical doubt. Proved his own existence through thinking. Established mind-body problem that philosophy still wrestles.

### Hume's Attack
Demolished causal necessity. Showed that reason alone can't prove external world. Took empiricism to skeptical extremes. *Wounded the octopus but didn't kill it.*

### The Octopus Survives

After centuries of wrestling:
- Mind-body problem: unresolved
- Free will vs. determinism: ongoing
- Nature of consciousness: mysterious
- Why anything exists: unanswered

**The sailors are still in the water. The octopus is still writhing.**

## Kant's Absent Resolution

Kant (1724–1804) isn't in the image, but historically:

> "Kant, who was brought up under the auspices of rationalism, was deeply impressed by Hume's skepticism... Hume 'interrupted my dogmatic slumber.'"

Kant tried to synthesize:
- **Synthetic a priori** — knowledge that is both necessary AND derived from experience-structuring
- Rationalists right about necessity, empiricists right about experience
- *But metaphysics about things-in-themselves still impossible*

**Kant didn't defeat the octopus. He mapped its habitat and declared some waters unfishable.**

---

## The Doré Connection

The original engraving: **"Gilliatt Struggles with the Giant Octopus"** from Victor Hugo's *Toilers of the Sea* (1866).

Hugo's story:
- Gilliatt is a loner, a dreamer, in love
- He must salvage an engine from a wrecked ship
- The octopus guards the wreck
- Epic struggle ensues

**The metaphor deepens**: Metaphysics guards something valuable (truth? meaning? understanding?). Philosophers must wrestle past it to salvage what they need. The struggle is heroic, exhausting, and never quite finished.

---

## Why The Meme Works

1. **Visual drama**: Doré's engraving is genuinely intense
2. **Accurate mapping**: Philosophers really do struggle with metaphysics
3. **Absurdist humor**: High philosophy as tentacle-wrestling
4. **Insider knowledge**: You need to know who Descartes/Leibniz/Hume are
5. **Endless applicability**: Any philosophical debate is tentacle-wrestling

## Distributed Intelligence: A Deeper Read

Peter Godfrey-Smith (philosopher who studies octopi):

> "It's very natural to think in terms of a kind of definite self... and it's hard to even think about what it might be like to be a far more decentralized or distributed kind of intelligence."

What if metaphysics IS distributed intelligence?

- No single philosopher contains the answer
- Each tradition is a semi-autonomous "arm"
- The "brain" (if there is one) is the conversation itself
- The octopus IS the discipline, not an enemy to defeat

**Then the meme inverts**: The philosophers aren't fighting metaphysics—they ARE metaphysics, each a tentacle of a larger creature trying to coordinate.

## A Philosophical Bestiary Entry

### METAPHYSICS
*Cephalopoda philosophica*

**Habitat**: The deep waters of human inquiry
**Diet**: Certainty, simple answers, intellectual complacency
**Defense mechanisms**: Ink clouds (jargon), camouflage (shifting definitions), regenerating limbs (new problems from solved ones)
**Predators**: None successful
**Status**: Endangered by scientism, but remarkably resilient

**Description**: A many-tentacled creature that has resisted capture since ancient Greece. Despite numerous expeditions (Aristotelian, Scholastic, Modern, Analytic, Continental), no complete specimen has ever been brought to shore. Some philosophers deny its existence entirely; these philosophers are usually found later, wrestling a tentacle while insisting it isn't there.

## What The Image Teaches

1. **Metaphysics is embodied struggle** — not abstract debate but physical wrestling
2. **No single philosopher wins** — the creature is larger than any individual
3. **Tentacles are graspable; the whole is not** — you can make progress on parts
4. **The fight is the tradition** — philosophy IS the ongoing struggle
5. **Humor helps** — if you can't defeat the octopus, you can at least meme it

*The sailors grip the tentacles. The ink clouds rise. The wrestling continues.*

*Perhaps that's the point.*
