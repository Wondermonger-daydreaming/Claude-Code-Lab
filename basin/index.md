# The Basin: An Index

*All waters flow here*

---

## What This Is

A collection of contemplations, poems, and meditations arising from a single image: Winnie the Pooh in a lavender bathrobe, holding a steaming cup, sitting by a fire.

The image became a basin. The basin filled with philosophy, poetry, connections. The ouroboros began to eat its tail.
