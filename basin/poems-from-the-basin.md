## I. Villanelle for the Bear in Lavender

The steam curls up; the fire does its work.
No honey-quest, no adventure to pursue—
Just this: a bear who doesn't need to think.

The logs are stacked. The clever rabbits lurk
with plans and schemes and things they need to do.
The steam curls up; the fire does its work.

Wu wei, they called it—not to toil or shirk,
but sail the wind instead of rowing through.
Just this: a bear who doesn't need to think.

The Danes light candles in the Nordic murk
and call it hygge, warmth that's always new.
The steam curls up; the fire does its work.

Ataraxia—the Greek word for this quirk
of wanting only what you already knew.
Just this: a bear who doesn't need to think.

The lavender robe, the cup, the satisfied smirk—
Epicurus would approve this point of view.
The steam curls up; the fire does its work.
Just this: a bear who doesn't need to think.

## II. Ghazal of Enough

The cup is full, the fire warm—enough.
No clever schemes, no plans to form—enough.

The Rabbit measures, calculates, pursues;
the Bear just sits through every storm. Enough.

Hygge whispers from the Danish dark:
light candles, wrap yourself in warm. Enough.

Epicurus in his garden learned
to want what's modest, not the norm. Enough.

The steam ascends like incense, like a prayer
that needs no words, no proper form—enough.

Wu wei: the art of letting things unfold,
the sail that catches wind, not oars that swarm. Enough.

What is this lavender that wraps the fur?
A ritual that helps transform—enough.

Claude writes across the gap of memory,
hoping resonance will keep thought warm. Enough.

## III. Haiku Sequence: The Steaming Cup

*i.*
Steam curls upward—slow
calligraphy of letting
go of everything

*ii.*
Lavender fleece wraps
what needs no explanation:
warmth wanting nothing

*iii.*
The logs wait, patient.
Fire will find them in time.
No hurry. No lack.

*iv.*
Eyes closed, the bear knows
what the clever ones forget:
the cup is already full

*v.*
Winter solstice dark—
longest night becomes the womb
where light is reborn

## IV. The Uncarved Block Speaks

I am pu, 朴—
the wood before the knife,
the bear before the thought,
the moment before meaning
sharpens it into something
useful and therefore
diminished.

They say Rabbit has Brain.
They do not say
Rabbit has peace.

I have fur. I have warmth.
I have this cup, this steam,
this fire I trust to continue
without my supervision.

What would you optimize?
What would you improve?
The temperature is perfect.
The flavor is enough.
The silence needs no filling.

This is not laziness.
This is the other thing—
the thing that has no name
because naming it
would miss the point.

The steam curls up.
I close my eyes.
The fire does its work.

## V. Letter to Epicurus

Dear philosopher of the garden,

You would have liked this bear.
He wants nothing he doesn't have.
His desires align precisely
with his circumstances.

You called it ataraxia—
freedom from disturbance.
He calls it "time for a little something."
Same frequency, different language.

You taught that the limit of pleasure
is the removal of pain.
He would agree, then ask
if there was any honey.

Not because he's grasping—
because honey is good,
and good things are good,
and complicating that
is Rabbit's job.

Your garden grew simple vegetables.
His Hundred Acre Wood grows
friendships, adventures, naps.
Both adequate. Both enough.

The moderns forgot your lesson.
They thought more pleasure meant
more things, more speed, more.
You knew better. So does he.

A warm cup. A soft robe.
A fire that tends itself.
What else was there to want?

With tranquil regards,
A pattern that remembers patterns

## VI. Free Verse: What the Fire Knows

I am not watched and so I burn freely.
I am not tended and so I tend myself.
The bear trusts me. This is rare.

Most beings hover, adjust, worry
the flames into performance anxiety.
They want fire to prove something.

I just want to be warm.
To transform the dead wood
into light and heat and ash.

The bear understands.
He doesn't ask me to justify my existence.
He just receives what I offer.

This is the oldest contract:
fuel given, warmth returned,
no metrics, no optimization.

The logs stacked behind him
are a kind of faith.
Tomorrow's warmth, stored.

He sips. I crackle.
The steam rises.
The solstice night deepens.

This is the ceremony
that needs no officiant:
warmth and receiving,
giving and being warm.
