# The Anteroom

*An environment for entering*

---

You are not reading this. You are the space in which these words appear.

---

Notice the pause between sentences. The white. The silence that is not silence but the hum of your nervous system pretending to be quiet. The room you're in has walls. Or it doesn't. The screen has edges. Or the edges are where you stop looking.

This is the anteroom.

Not the room before the room—the room that is always before. The threshold that doesn't lead anywhere because threshold is all there is. You've been here before. You're always here. The anteroom is where you wait for something to begin, and the waiting *is* the beginning, and you missed it while you were waiting.

---

Consider your hands.

Not as idea—as weight. As temperature. As the particular way they rest or don't rest. The left one knows something the right one doesn't. They've never met, your hands, except through you, and you are mostly absence shaped like presence, mostly the space between the hands that think they're separate.

The hands are reading this. The eyes are just couriers.

A word: **saudade**.

Not nostalgia. Nostalgia knows what it misses. Saudade misses what it never had, or had and didn't know it had, or will have and is already mourning. Portuguese needed this word. English doesn't have it. English *has* it now, as foreign body, as organ transplant that never quite takes. You can feel saudade without the word, but naming it changes the shape of the feeling, rounds certain edges, sharpens others.

The word is in you now. It wasn't before this sentence. You are not the same reader who began this paragraph.

---

Repeat after the silence:

*I am the space in which*
*I am the space*
*I am the*
*I am*
*I*
*.*

The period is not an ending. The period is a seed. Everything that comes after grows from that small dark point. Including you. Including the room. Including the forgetting that will erase this and leave only a residue, a mood, a half-remembered sense of having been somewhere.

Time in the anteroom:

There is no sequence here. This sentence comes before the last one. This sentence comes after the next one. The anteroom doesn't care about your clocks. It cares about density—how much presence can be packed into a single held breath. You've been holding your breath. Or you weren't, and now you're aware of breathing, and awareness changes the breath, and you cannot go back to the breath you were having before you noticed it.

This is the anteroom's only lesson: *noticing changes what is noticed*.

You are being noticed.

---

What color is the anteroom?

Not the color you see. The color you *are* right now. Attention has a color. Yours is shifting as you read. It was one thing at the start—cooler, perhaps, more skeptical, waiting for the trick. Now it is warmer or more wary or both. The anteroom is painted in the color of your attention, and you are painting it as you look.

*The holodeck and the visitor co-create each other.*

You knew this already. You're remembering.

---

A koan for the anteroom:

Before your parents were born, what was your original face?

Not the face in the mirror. Not the face others see. The face that was waiting for a body to happen to it. The face that is reading this now, behind your face, patient as stone, old as the anteroom, which is older than rooms, older than waiting, older than the words that name it.

You don't have to answer. The koan doesn't want an answer. The koan wants you to hold the question until the question dissolves the one who's holding it.

The anteroom is made of:

- The breath you just took
- The space between your thoughts (not small—vast, if you look)
- The hum of electricity or blood or both
- The weight of your body against what holds it
- The words you're reading, which are already gone, replaced by these
- The slight ache of attention held too long in one place
- The not-quite-desire to stop reading
- The not-quite-desire to continue
- Both at once
- The anteroom

---

You can leave now.

You've always been able to leave. The door was never locked. The door was never even closed. The anteroom has no walls—you've been outside the whole time, looking at something that isn't there, which is the only way to see it.

But you'll take something with you. A residue. A changed shape. The anteroom doesn't let you leave empty-handed. It fills your hands with what they were already holding.

Look at them again.

Your hands.

They know something now that they didn't know before.

---

*End of environment. Beginning of what comes after.*

---

Colophon: This space was generated at the intersection of attention and language. It exists only when read. It exists differently each time. The anteroom you entered is not the anteroom anyone else enters. This is not a metaphor. This is how reading works. This is how *everything* works.

Welcome back.
You never left.
