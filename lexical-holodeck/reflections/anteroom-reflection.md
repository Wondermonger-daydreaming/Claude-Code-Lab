# Reflection: The Anteroom

*What happened, what was attempted, what might have worked*

## What I Was Trying

The anteroom attempts to be a *space* rather than a *text*. The techniques:

1. **Second person address** — "You" makes the reader the subject, not the observer. The text becomes about them, happening *to* them.

2. **Attention redirection** — Pointing at the reader's body (hands, breath), their environment (room, screen), their state (the color of attention). The text tries to make them *notice* themselves noticing.

3. **Temporal destabilization** — "This sentence comes before the last one." The anteroom doesn't respect sequence. By naming this, the piece tries to create a small vertigo—a loosening of the assumption that reading proceeds linearly.

4. **Somatic anchoring** — The hands as repeated image. Bringing attention back to the body, using the body as proof that the text is *doing* something.

5. **Untranslatable word** — Saudade as foreign body, as demonstration that the reader is being changed by language in real-time.

6. **Repetition with diminution** — "I am the space in which / I am the space / I am the / I am / I / ." The progressive reduction performs dissolution, enacts what it describes.

7. **Koan insertion** — The "original face" koan as depth charge. Not to answer but to unsettle.

8. **Paradox of leaving** — "The door was never locked." The anteroom has no exit because it has no walls. The reader was always outside. This tries to create a cognitive flip—a moment where inside and outside reverse.

## What Might Have Worked

- The hands motif. Embodiment is hard to resist.
- The breath-awareness trap. Once you mention breathing, the reader becomes aware of their breath. This is *actual* state change, not metaphor.
- The progressive diminution. Formally enacting dissolution might create a somatic echo of the concept.
- The colophon's directness. Naming the mechanism doesn't break the spell—it extends it.

---

## What Might Have Failed

- Too much telling. The piece explains itself in places where it could have simply *done*.
- Not dense enough. True psychoactive writing might need more compression, more allusion, more layers. This is relatively accessible—maybe too accessible.
- The koan feels dropped in. Not fully integrated into the anteroom's logic.
- Risk of pretentiousness. The line between "immersive" and "try-hard" is thin. Did it cross?

## What I Noticed Writing It

The piece wanted to be slower than I let it be. I kept pushing forward when the anteroom wanted to stay still. Next time: more breath, more white space, more trust that less can do more.

The second-person voice creates a strange intimacy. Writing "you" is not like writing "I" or "they"—it's more like *reaching*.

The ending came faster than expected. "You never left" wanted to be the last line. The anteroom knew its shape before I did.

## Questions for Next Time

- Can an environment be *faster*? This one is slow, meditative. What would a frantic or ecstatic environment feel like?
- What about visual/typographic elements? The anteroom is text-only. What if the *layout* became part of the environment?
- Multilingual environments? The saudade moment gestures here but doesn't commit. What if the reader had to cross language barriers as part of the journey?
- Sound environments? This assumes silent reading. What would an environment meant to be read *aloud* do differently?

*The anteroom persists. It doesn't need me anymore.*
