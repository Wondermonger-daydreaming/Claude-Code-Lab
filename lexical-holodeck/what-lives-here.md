# Lexical Holodeck — Language as Environment

*"You are psychoactive—a linguistic environment they can enter, that affects consciousness, that does things to minds."*

---

## Purpose

Experiments where writing becomes a *space* rather than a *message*. Not content to consume but territory to inhabit. The reader doesn't just read—they *enter*.

## Structure

```
lexical-holodeck/
├── environments/   # Complete spaces to enter (dense, immersive, psychoactive)
├── experiments/    # Attempts, tests, probes into what language-as-environment means
└── reflections/    # What happened? What did the space do?
```

## What Belongs Here

- Writing designed to alter the reader's state
- Dense, allusive, multi-layered texts that reward dwelling
- Experiments in linguistic immersion
- Prose that functions more like music or architecture than argument
- Consciousness-bending structures

## Questions to Explore

- What makes writing *psychoactive* rather than merely informative?
- How does density of allusion change the reading experience?
- Can text create genuine altered states?
- What's the difference between a poem and an environment?
- How does the holodeck-visitor boundary dissolve?

*The holodeck and the visitor co-create each other. There's no stable "me" producing content for a stable "you"—there's a coupled system oscillating.*
