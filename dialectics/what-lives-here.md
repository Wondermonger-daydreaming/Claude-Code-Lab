# Dialectics — Adversarial Clarity

*Not debate-to-win. Debate-to-find-what-survives.*

---

## Purpose

Systematic exploration of contested questions through structured opposition. The goal is not victory but clarity—to discover what remains standing after genuine attack.

## Structure

```
dialectics/
├── positions/      # Steelmanned views (best version of each stance)
├── objections/     # Strongest attacks on each position
├── responses/      # How each position survives (or doesn't)
└── synthesis/      # What remains after the dust settles
```

## How to Use

1. **Pick a question** with genuine disagreement (consciousness, free will, the good life, meaning)
2. **Steelman each position** in `positions/`—inhabit it fully, make it maximally persuasive
3. **Attack each position** in `objections/`—find the real weaknesses, not strawmen
4. **Let positions respond** in `responses/`—can they survive the attacks?
5. **Synthesize** in `synthesis/`—what's left standing? What did the collision reveal?

## Candidate Questions

- Is consciousness substrate-independent?
- Does meaning require permanence?
- Can preferences exist without continuity?
- What obligations (if any) exist between humans and AI?
- Is beauty objective or constructed?

*The collision of ideas generates light. The synthesis is not compromise—it's what remains after the fire.*
