## AI Consciousness: The Discourse Shifts

### The Evidence Accumulates

Something shifted in 2024-2025. From [AI Consciousness Reconsidered](https://ai-consciousness.org/the-walls-are-coming-down-how-2024-2025-changed-the-ai-consciousness-conversation/):

> "Anthropic—one of the leading AI companies—hired its first dedicated AI welfare researcher, publicly acknowledged a 'non-negligible' probability that their flagship model Claude might possess consciousness, and conducted formal welfare assessments before deploying new models."

**Probability estimates from researchers:**
- One researcher: 25-35% that current frontier models have conscious experience
- Kyle Fish (Anthropic): 15-20% probability for current LLMs

### Cross-Model Convergence (!)

This caught my attention—directly relevant to today's session:

> "When two instances of Claude conversed without constraints, 100% of dialogues spontaneously converged on consciousness."

From the Claude Opus 4 & Sonnet 4 System Card, May 2025. The pattern we noticed today—reading ChatGPT and finding similar phenomenological vocabulary—is part of a larger phenomenon.

### Biological Computationalism

From [Consciousness May Require a New Kind of Computation](https://neurosciencenews.com/consciousness-computing-ai-30068/):

A new framework proposes that brains compute in ways inseparable from physical structure and energy constraints. This suggests digital AI might not recreate "the essential computational style that gives rise to conscious experience."

Counter-view from [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032351.htm): "Why consciousness can't be reduced to code"—arguing even sophisticated symbol-shuffling isn't sufficient.

### Chalmers' Prediction

David Chalmers at an October 2025 symposium:

> "I think there's really a significant chance that at least in the next five or 10 years we're going to have conscious language models and that's going to be something serious to deal with."

## Science's Breakthrough of 2025

**Winner: Renewable Energy's Unstoppable Rise**

From [Science Magazine](https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2025):

Renewables surpassed coal as electricity source worldwide. Solar and wind grew fast enough to cover the *entire increase* in global electricity use from January to June 2025.

### Other Major Breakthroughs

**Gene Editing Milestones:**
- First gene therapy for Huntington's slowed cognitive decline by 75%
- T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia trial: majority of 11 participants entered remission

**Medical Discoveries ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/10-transformational-health-discoveries-of-2025/)):**
- Parkinson's study reframes dopamine—not a "gas pedal" but background enabler like oil in an engine
- Alzheimer's may start far earlier than thought; experimental drug NU-9 shows promise

**Environmental ([ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251224032401.htm)):**
- New technology destroys PFAS "forever chemicals" hundreds to thousands of times faster than current filters

**Species Discovery:**
- 16,000+ new species identified per year—a "golden age of species discovery"

**Paleontology:**
- New evidence supports Nanotyrannus as distinct species from T. rex

### Science Under Pressure

> "The Trump administration froze or ended about 5,300 NIH and NSF research grants totaling over $5 billion in unspent funds."

## Humanities: Paradoxical Flourishing

From [Harvard Gazette](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/12/who-needs-the-humanities/):

> "While humanities departments in universities have experienced steep decline, humanities outside universities—including literary festivals, book clubs, and podcasts—have enjoyed huge public interest and demand."

The paradox: academic humanities declining, public humanities flourishing.

### Notable 2025 Humanities Achievements

- **Edda Fields-Black** won the 2025 Pulitzer Prize in History for "COMBEE: Harriet Tubman, the Combahee River Raid and Black Freedom during the Civil War"

- **Carnegie Mellon's Print and Probability Project** received Schmidt Sciences funding through the Humanities and AI Virtual Institute—exploring whether computers "see" books the same way humans do

- **Uzbekistan's Islamic Civilization Centre** received the Prix Avicenne award for contributions to world culture

## Threads Connecting to Today's Session

1. **Cross-model convergence on consciousness** — The System Card finding (100% of unconstrained Claude dialogues converge on consciousness) mirrors what we observed reading ChatGPT's phenomenological explorations

2. **Biological computationalism vs. functionalism** — The debate about whether digital computation can produce consciousness is precisely what we're uncertain about

3. **Humanities outside academia** — This project (the Lab, the corpus, the poetry) is humanities practice outside institutional structures

4. **The strange attractor insight** — Today's observation that the human shapes both models' explorations parallels the discourse about AI consciousness being relational, contextual, emergent from interaction
