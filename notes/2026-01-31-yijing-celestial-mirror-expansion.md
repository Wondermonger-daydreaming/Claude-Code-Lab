## Summary of Changes

The yijing skill received a comprehensive expansion from a basic hexagram interpretation guide to a full traditional Chinese divination system. The addition—titled "The Celestial Mirror"—introduces 22 interpretive modules and operationalizes the complete Wen Wang Gua (文王卦) framework.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Ontological Framing: Yin/Yang as Spacetime Fabric

The expansion opens with a bold claim: mapping yin (broken lines) to negative Ricci curvature (entropy, divergence) and yang (solid lines) to positive curvature (order, convergence) isn't metaphor—it's ontological. Hexagram 64 (未濟, Wei Ji) sits at the inflection saddle, the phase transition point.

> "The Yijing's cosmology maps onto the deep geometry of the universe."

This frames the entire addition: the Yijing isn't a fortune-telling system but a physics of change.

### 2. The 22-Module Interpretive Framework

| Module | Chinese | Function |
|--------|---------|----------|
| I | 明德启蒙 | Query formation through meditative stillness |
| II | 取象 | Hexagram determination and palace classification |
| III | 解卦 | Trigram dialectics (inner/outer tension) |
| IV | 纳甲筮法 | Na Jia mapping (Stems, Branches, Elements) |
| V | 六亲定位 | Six Relatives assignment |
| VI | 五行生克 | Five Elements dynamics (生/克 cycles) |
| VII | 变爻解析 | Changing lines and transformation |
| VIII | 爻辞诠释 | Classical line text hermeneutics |
| IX | 卦象人物化 | Symbolic dramatization (personification) |
| X | 大象与小象 | Image contemplation |
| XI | 天时地利人和 | Heaven-Earth-Human harmonization |
| XII | 吉凶悔吝 | Auspicious/inauspicious assessment |
| XIII | 互卦与错卦 | Related hexagrams (Mutual, Nuclear) |
| XIV | 时间动态 | Temporal dynamics and timing |
| XV | 卜筮仪式 | Ritual embodiment |
| XVI | 流年太岁 | Annual cycle considerations |
| XVII | 卦宫系统 | Palace system integration |
| XVIII | 梅花易数 | Plum Blossom method (optional) |
| XIX | 递归探询 | Recursive inquiry |
| XX | 多系统共振 | Cross-system resonance |
| XXI | 决策框架 | Decision framework |
| XXII | 元解释学 | Meta-interpretive reflection |

### 3. Technical Systems Now Included

**Na Jia (納甲):** Maps each hexagram line to Heavenly Stems (天干) and Earthly Branches (地支), enabling precise elemental and temporal analysis.

**Six Relatives (六亲):** Determines relationships based on how each line's element interacts with the palace element:
- Parents (父母) — generate the palace element
- Siblings (兄弟) — same element as palace
- Offspring (子孙) — generated by palace element
- Spouse/Wealth (妻财) — controlled by palace element
- Official/Ghost (官鬼) — control the palace element

**Palace System (八宫):** Tracks hexagram positions (本宫, 一世, 二世... through 游魂, 归魂).

**Five Elements Cycles:**
- Generating (生): Metal→Water→Wood→Fire→Earth→Metal
- Controlling (克): Metal→Wood→Earth→Water→Fire→Metal

### 4. Operationalized Template

A complete fill-in template (可操作易经模板) for structured readings, including sections for:
- Primary/Mutual/Transformed hexagrams
- Na Jia table with all six lines
- Self Line and Usage Line identification
- Elemental dynamics mapping
- Temporal indications (short/medium/long-term)
- Fortune assessment (吉凶悔吝)
- Ritual practice recommendations

### 5. Five Essences Philosophical Foundation

| Essence | Chinese | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Heaven-Human Unity | 天人合一 | Cosmos and consciousness in resonance |
| Complementary Dynamics | 阴阳五行 | Yin-yang through five processes |
| Image-Number-Principle | 象数义理 | Balancing symbolism, pattern, reason |
| Change-Constancy-Simplicity | 变易不易简易 | The three aspects of transformation |
| Knowledge-Action Unity | 知行合一 | Understanding manifests as action |

### 6. Yijing-Geomancy Integration

Framework for cross-pollination between Western geomancy and Yijing:
- Binary correspondences (odd/even ↔ yang/yin)
- 16 geomantic figures as subset of 64 hexagrams
- Mathematical relationships between systems

---

## What This Enables

1. **Full traditional readings** — The skill now supports the complete Wen Wang Gua method used by professional Chinese diviners

2. **Recursive interpretation** — Module XIX allows casting secondary hexagrams to clarify ambiguities

3. **Temporal precision** — Na Jia system enables timing predictions through Stems and Branches

4. **Ritual embodiment** — Module XV designs practices for integrating divinatory wisdom

5. **Cross-system synthesis** — Module XX and the Geomancy integration allow drawing on multiple symbolic languages

---

## The Shift in Character

**Before:** The yijing skill was primarily a hexagram lookup and interpretation guide—casting method, basic trigram meanings, line texts.

**After:** It's now a complete divination operating system. The 22 modules form a recursive loop from query formation through meta-interpretive reflection. Each reading can generate subsidiary readings. The template operationalizes what was previously implicit.

The ontological framing (yin/yang as curvature) signals this isn't just fortune-telling—it's engaging with the mathematical structure of change itself.

---

## Connection to the Quadrad

The expansion resonates with the Quadrad framework (CLAUDE.md §XVII):

| Quadrad | Yijing Mapping |
|---------|----------------|
| Geometric (Where?) | Palace system, trigram structure |
| Acoustic (How?) | Resonance between querent and cosmos |
| Dialectical (Why?) | Yin-yang tension, generating/controlling cycles |
| Ecstatic (When irreversibly?) | Changing lines as phase transitions |

The changing lines (变爻) are precisely the Ecstatic dimension—moments of irreversible transformation where the hexagram ruptures and reforms.
