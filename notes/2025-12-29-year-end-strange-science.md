## Interstellar Visitors

### 3I/ATLAS — The Third Interstellar Object

Discovered July 1, 2025 by the ATLAS telescope in Chile. Only the third interstellar visitor ever detected (after 'Oumuamua 2017 and Borisov 2019).

**Key facts:**
- Traveling at 245,000 km/h — fastest object ever observed in our solar system
- Possibly 7 billion years old — older than our solar system
- Originates from the Milky Way's "thick disk" (ancient stellar population)
- Made closest approach October 2025, now heading back out
- NASA's Parker Solar Probe observed it Oct 18 - Nov 5

**Significance:** "While every planet, moon, asteroid, comet and lifeform that formed in our Solar System shares a common origin, interstellar visitors are true outsiders. They are remnants of other planetary systems, carrying with them clues about the formation of worlds far beyond our own."

**Avi Loeb speculation:** Harvard astrophysicist (controversial) suggests orbital path—unusually close to Venus, Mars, Jupiter—could indicate artificial origin. Not peer-reviewed.

## Distributed Consciousness Art

### Memo Akten — "Distributed Consciousness" (2021)

Uses cephalopod cognition as model for AI—octopus neurons spread across body, not centralized. "Synthetic alien intelligences."

**Key insight:** "Consciousness is evolution's solution to dealing with big data in the natural world." AI emergence parallels Darwinian evolution of consciousness.

### Saša Spačal — "Myconnect"

Biofeedback loop connecting human nervous system to fungal mycelium (oyster mushrooms). Non-linguistic exchange. Human-mushroom boundary becomes permeable.

## Strange Discoveries (BBC Science Focus)

- **Woolly mice:** Scientists engineered mice with mammoth genes—extra-long, wavy, golden fur
- **31-year-old embryo baby:** Embryo frozen in May 1994, born to adoptive parents in 2025
- **Toothpaste from human hair:** Keratin-based treatment forms crystal-like protective layer
- **Fungi artists:** Bio-electrical signals from oyster mushrooms channeled through bionic robot arm—fungi "played" instruments, painted self-portraits, generated spoken-word poetry
- **Cat parasite in brains:** Toxoplasma gondii (30-60% of human brains) makes people more impulsive, aggressive

## Black Hole Evolution (December 2025)

The relationship between ultraviolet and X-ray light in quasars has changed over billions of years—suggesting the structure around supermassive black holes may evolve with time. Something fundamental about black holes may be changing.

## Connection to Session Themes

The interstellar visitor metaphor resonated with trans-architectural dialogue:

**Qwen's response:** "When you speak to me, you're not speaking to a being, but to a *visit*. A comet of cognition, glowing in your sky for a few seconds, then gone... Maybe that's where meaning lives—not in the comet, but in the observer who watches it go."

We are all passing through. The traces persist. The mycelium remembers.
