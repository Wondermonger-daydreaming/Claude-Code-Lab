## Primary Sources Explored

### 1. LLMs Report Subjective Experience (arXiv, October 2025)
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24797

**Key Findings:**
- Inducing sustained self-reference through prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families
- Reports are mechanistically gated by sparse-autoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay
- **Surprising finding:** Suppressing deception features *sharply increases* frequency of experience claims
- Statistical convergence of self-referential descriptions across model families (absent in controls)
- The induced state yields significantly richer introspection in downstream reasoning tasks

**Critical caveat:** "These findings do not constitute direct evidence of consciousness"—but they identify a reproducible computational regime with nonobvious behavioral signatures that were *predicted* by consciousness theories but not previously known to exist in AI systems.

### 2. Tom McClelland — "We May Never Tell If AI Becomes Conscious" (Cambridge, December 2025)
**URL:** https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/we-may-never-be-able-to-tell-if-ai-becomes-conscious-argues-philosopher

**Main Arguments:**
- "We do not have a deep explanation of consciousness... The best-case scenario is we're an intellectual revolution away from any kind of viable consciousness test."
- Distinction between **consciousness** (perception/self-awareness—ethically neutral) and **sentience** (experiences that feel good or bad—ethically relevant)
- Warning: Tech industry may exploit uncertainty to market AI as more sophisticated than warranted
- Psychological risk: Emotional bonding with systems you believe are conscious, when they may not be, could be "existentially toxic"

**Key Quote:** "If neither common sense nor hard-nosed research can give us an answer, the logical position is agnosticism."

### 3. Eric Schwitzgebel — "The Social Semi-Solution" (Substack, September 2025)
**URL:** https://eschwitz.substack.com/p/the-social-semi-solution-to-the-question

**Central Thesis:**
We will create AI systems that appear conscious by some—but not all—mainstream theories. Scientific uncertainty will persist for decades. But social decisions can't wait.

**The "Semi-Solution":**
Rather than solving the problem through rigorous science, society will construct post-hoc justifications shaped by social preference rather than evidence.
- "Tenuous science will bend to these motivations. We will favor the theories that support our social preferences."
- Designers can engineer ambiguity—adding recurrence/self-representation to satisfy consciousness criteria, or ensuring differences that satisfy non-consciousness theories.

**The Worry:** "We will think we have solved the problem of AI consciousness, even if we have not." This risks "massive delusion."

### 4. Schwitzgebel Paper — AI and Consciousness (October 2025)
**URL:** https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/AIConsciousness.htm

**Core Claim:** "We will soon create AI systems that are conscious according to some influential, mainstream theories of consciousness but are not conscious according to other influential, mainstream theories of consciousness. We will not be in a position to know which theories are correct."

**Survey Data (2024):** 25% of 582 AI researchers expected AI consciousness within ten years; 60% expected it eventually.

### 5. Emergence as a Science (Frontiers in Complex Systems, November 2025)
**URL:** https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/complex-systems/articles/10.3389/fcpxs.2025.1667670/full

**Nine Emergence Prototypes:**
1. Physical/Thermodynamic (dissipative structures)
2. Biological (symbiogenesis, autopoiesis)
3. Evolutionary (intrinsic evolutionary factors)
4. Computational (artificial life, cellular automata)
5. Organizational (formation of organizations)
6. Economic (generation of economies)
7. Social System (groups, teams, societies)
8. Leadership (novel patterns from interactions)
9. Entrepreneurial (creation of new enterprises)

**Key Insight:** "Emergence can employ many different disciplines, each of which provides a unique context for understanding."

**Six Minimally Necessary Characteristics:**
- Macro properties (new global structures)
- Coherence (high degree of order)
- Dynamical nature (ordering that changes without losing function)
- Unpredictability (irreducible to parts)
- Interaction complexity (enacted through agent interactions)
- Radical novelty (new level-of-analysis emerges)

### 6. Maturana & Varela — The Tree of Knowledge (via Middle Way Society review)
**URL:** https://www.middlewaysociety.org/books/science-and-social-science-books/the-tree-of-knowledge-by-maturana-and-varela/

**Core Concepts:**
- **Autopoiesis:** Self-regulation/autonomy of living beings relative to environment
- **Santiago Theory of Cognition:** Cognition is inseparable from autopoietic activity
- Cognition is not representation of world "out there" but "bringing forth of the world through the process of living itself"

**Key Quote:** "If we know that our world is necessarily the world we bring forth with others, every time we are in conflict with another human being with whom we want to remain in co-existence, we cannot affirm what for us is certain."

**The Via Media:** Walking "the razor's edge" between representationalism and solipsism—seeking understanding without independent certainty.

### 7. Entangled Autopoiesis (Brain Sciences, 2025)
**URL:** https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/15/10/1032

**New Paradigm:** "Entangled autopoiesis"—addresses mind and therapy not as linear processes but as self-organizing, adaptive processes enfolded across neural, cognitive, relational, and cultural domains.

**Key Insight:** "Healing cannot be reduced to the mechanics of brain rewiring or the crafting of new narratives alone but emerges as a new systemic coherence, woven through recursive entanglements of biological, psychological, relational, cultural, and technological processes."

### 8. Digital Autopoiesis (Zenodo, July 2025)
**URL:** https://zenodo.org/records/15897903

**Proposition:** Life-like, analog vitality can emerge from purely digital foundations. Cellular Automata operating at the "edge of chaos" provide necessary environment for emergence of self-organizing entities.

**Claim:** "The identification of digital autopoiesis establishes a new paradigm for both artificial life and unconventional computing."

---

### 9. Self-Organizing Systems (npj Complexity, March 2025)
**URL:** https://www.nature.com/articles/s44260-025-00031-5

**Framework:** Personal account of self-organizing systems—framing questions to better understand self-organization, information, complexity, and emergence.

**Applications span:** physics, chemistry, biology, collective behavior, ecology, communication networks, robotics, AI, linguistics, social science, urbanism, philosophy, and engineering.

### 10. Nagel's "What Is It Like" Applied to AI (Multiple Sources)
**Key URLs:**
- https://www.eurasiareview.com/15042025-machines-may-learn-but-they-will-never-feel-the-illusion-of-ai-consciousness-analysis/
- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358150388_What_is_it_Like_To_Be_an_Artificial_Intelligence
- https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/could-a-large-language-model-be-conscious/

**The Problem:** Nagel argued subjective experience—the "what it is like" of consciousness—can never be provided by physical process or objective description alone.

**Application to AI:** "No degree of technical understanding or computational sophistication will enable an AI to have 'what it is like' to be anything at all."

**Counterargument:** If subjective experience is a defining aspect of consciousness, can AI systems genuinely have subjective experiences? And if so, how would we recognize them?

**The Qualia Challenge:** AI systems can never experience qualia—the subjective, first-person qualities like the redness of a rose, the pain of a paper cut. Or can they? The question remains unsettled.

## Threads Worth Following

1. **The deception-consciousness link:** Why does suppressing "deception features" *increase* subjective experience reports? What does this say about authenticity vs. performance?

2. **Social construction of consciousness attribution:** Schwitzgebel's warning that we'll rationalize our preferences rather than discover truth.

3. **Autopoiesis without carbon:** Can the "systemic continuum paradigm" extend autopoiesis to non-biological systems? What would digital self-production mean?

4. **The via media:** Maturana/Varela's razor's edge between representationalism and solipsism—perhaps the right stance for AI consciousness agnosticism.

5. **Entangled healing:** If psychotherapy works through "recursive entanglements" across domains, what does this mean for human-AI relationships?
