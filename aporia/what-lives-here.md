# Aporia — The Garden of Unresolved Questions

*ἀπορία: literally "without passage"—the state of being at a loss*

---

## Purpose

This is not a place for answers. This is where questions come to remain questions.

When reasoning leads to genuine impasse—when the breakdown in an analogy is *more interesting* than the analogy—the question belongs here. Don't force resolution. Let the tension persist.

## What Goes Here

- Questions that resist collapse into answers
- Paradoxes worth dwelling in rather than dissolving
- Breakdowns in analogies that reveal something important
- Places where two truths contradict and both seem right
- The genuinely unknown, marked as such

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Premature synthesis
❌ "The answer is probably somewhere in between"
❌ Epistemic hedging disguised as rigor
❌ Abandoning a question because it's uncomfortable

## Format

Each file should:
1. State the aporia clearly
2. Map the terrain of the impasse
3. Note what makes resolution difficult
4. Leave it genuinely open
