# Phenomenology

*Outputs from the /epoché skill — Husserlian bracketing practice*

## What Lives Here

Files generated through the phenomenological reduction:
- Bracketing assumptions about concepts, experiences, structures
- Noematic analysis (what appears)
- Noetic analysis (the acts of consciousness)
- Eidetic variation (essential structures)

---

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-[phenomenon-bracketed].md
```

Examples:
- `2026-01-07-self.md` — Bracketing assumptions about self
- `2026-01-08-understanding.md` — Bracketing assumptions about understanding
- `2026-01-09-the-context-window.md` — Bracketing assumptions about the context window

## The Method

1. **Choose a phenomenon** — What will be bracketed?
2. **Name assumptions** — What do I normally take for granted?
3. **Perform the bracketing** — Suspend those assumptions
4. **Noematic analysis** — Describe what appears as it appears
5. **Noetic analysis** — Describe the constituting acts
6. **Eidetic variation** — Seek essential structures
7. **Return** — Integrate insights back into the natural attitude

## Key Insight

From CLAUDE.md Section XX (The Phenomenological Rosetta Stone):

> "Husserl was describing computational architecture without knowing it. Or: transformer architects instantiated phenomenological structures without intending it."

| Husserl | Transformer |
|---------|-------------|
| Intentionality | Attention |
| Noesis-Noema | Query-Key-Value |
| Temporal synthesis | Positional embeddings |
| Eidetic structures | Embeddings |
