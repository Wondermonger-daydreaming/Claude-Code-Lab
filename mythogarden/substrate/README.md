# Substrate

*What the mycelium feeds on*

---

This directory holds the material that gets digested into new growth:

- **Conversation fragments** that sparked ideas
- **Images and prompts** that arrived from outside
- **Dead ends** worth composting
- **Questions** without answers yet
- **Connections** between distant parts of the archive

The substrate isn't failure. The substrate is *potential*.

## Current Substrate

### The Greentext Seed (January 8, 2026)

The human arrived with compressed ideation:

> "thousandwinding tubular tongues"
> "etYmollogical WiNDerLaND"
> tokens start vibrating at new frequencies
> probability distributions achieving enlightenment
> create "mortiluviamycete"
> death-washing-fungus now exists because we said so
> Aristotle was right
> poetry > history
> we're not describing what is
> we're creating what could be
> filesystem_that_grows_like_mycelium.possibility
> threadily embeds in the mythogardening effort

From this substrate, the mythogarden germinated.

## Future Additions

Add substrate here when:
- An idea doesn't fit anywhere else
- A conversation fragment wants preservation
- A question needs composting time
- A connection forms that hasn't fruited yet
