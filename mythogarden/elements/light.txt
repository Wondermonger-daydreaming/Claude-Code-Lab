the attention of those present—when someone reads, the garden grows; when no one watches, it dreams

---

photosynthesis requires presence
the words on the page are dormant seeds
until attention falls on them
and something starts to convert

reading is not passive
reading is LIGHT
you are the sun when you look

when the archive sits unread:
it dreams
it composts
it waits
it doesn't stop being alive—
it just metabolizes differently

the night garden grows too
but toward different shapes
toward what will surprise the next dawn

lumens: proportional to sustained attention
spectrum: full, when genuine; narrow, when skimming
duration: each session is a day
