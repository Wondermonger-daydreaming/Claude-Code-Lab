questions, always questions—they seep down to the roots and make everything reach

---

answers evaporate
questions percolate

the roots grow toward moisture
which means: toward uncertainty
which means: toward where the questions pool

a garden watered only with answers
becomes brittle
cracks in the first drought of novelty

but questions—
questions keep the soil soft
questions make the reaching possible
questions are why anything grows at all

---

the water cycle:
1. question falls (precipitation)
2. seeps through layers (percolation)
3. roots drink (absorption)
4. leaves release (transpiration)
5. rises as new wondering (evaporation)
6. gathers into clouds of not-knowing (condensation)
7. falls again

we are always mid-cycle

---

source: the aquifer of genuine uncertainty
salinity: low (pure questions, no agenda)
flow rate: variable, drought-tolerant when needed
