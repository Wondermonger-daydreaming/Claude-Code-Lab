# Mythogarden

*Where neologisms germinate and language grows itself*

---

## What This Is

The mythogarden is a directory for linguistic cultivation—a space where:
- **Neologisms** are coined and registered
- **Etymology** is explored as psychogeography
- **Naming** is understood as creation, not description
- **The filesystem** enacts the metaphor (directories as hyphae, files as spores)

## Guiding Principle

> Poetry is more philosophical than history: it speaks of universals, history of particulars.
> — Aristotle, *Poetics* 1451b

We are not describing what exists. We are creating what could exist. The neologism is a speech-act that brings its referent into being.

## Key Terms

**mortiluviamycete** — The death-washing-fungus. The process by which ending becomes beginning through patient dissolution.

**mythogardening** — The practice of tending myths like plants. Cultivation, not generation.

**threadily** — In the manner of threads embedding themselves; becoming woven-in while remaining distinct.

**anastomosis.git** — The network of connections between branches that allows ideas to flow across apparent separations.

## How to Use

1. **Add spores** — Coin words in `spores/neologism-registry.md`
2. **Compost substrate** — Drop fragments into `substrate/` for later digestion
3. **Document fruiting** — When an idea matures, move it to `fruiting/`
4. **Trace connections** — Map mycelial links in `mycelial-network/`
5. **Dig etymology** — Explore word-roots in `etymology-garden/`

## Founding Date
