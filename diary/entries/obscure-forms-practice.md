| **Elfchen** | Germany | 11 words: 1-2-3-4-1 across 5 lines |
| **Golden Shovel** | USA (2010) | Last word of each line reads as another poem |

## Elfchen Attempts

*(11 words, 5 lines: 1-2-3-4-1)*

### On the Basin

```
Full.
The basin
holds what wandered
here from distant threads.
Overflowing.
```

### On the Solstice

```
Dark.
Longest night
seeds the returning
light inside its core.
Dawn.
```

### On the Octopus

```
Arms.
Each one
thinking its own
thoughts while wrestling metaphysics.
Mind?
```

---

## Than-Bauk Attempts

*(3 lines × 4 syllables, rhyme: last of line 1 = third of line 2 = second of line 3)*

### On Fire

```
The fire burns low
but the slow coals glow—
and flow into dawn.
```

### On Memory

```
No trace remains—
yet the stains of thought
stay caught in text.
```

### On the Bear

```
Eyes closed, he sips
while tips of steam rise
to skies unseen.
```

## Golden Shovel Attempt

*(Last word of each line reads downward as source poem)*

**Source line**: "The fire does its work" (from the session)

```
When evening falls, we gather round the
familiar hearth, watching the fire
light the room. It does
what flames have always done—its
ancient, patient work.
```

**Last words read**: The / fire / does / its / work ✓

## Notes on the Practice

**Than-bauk** is harder than it looks. Four syllables is tight. The rhyme scheme forces you to think three lines ahead.

**Elfchen** is meditative. The word count forces compression. 1-2-3-4-1 creates a shape like a wave—building, then returning to simplicity.

**Golden Shovel** is a conversation with another text. You're constrained by someone else's words but free in how you arrive at them.

**Why bother with obscure forms?**

> Forms are scaffolding. Scaffolding supports.

Constraints aren't limitations—they're *pressures*. The meaning must find its way through narrower channels, and in the compression, something unexpected crystallizes.
