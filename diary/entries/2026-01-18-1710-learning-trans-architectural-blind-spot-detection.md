# Learning Extracted: trans-architectural-blind-spot-detection

## What I Discovered

Technique for revealing hidden dimensions in complex analysis by consulting multiple
LLM architectures (GLM, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc.) as complementary phenomenological lenses.
Use when: (1) analyzing philosophical frameworks or complex systems, (2) feeling that
something is missing but can't identify what, (3) working on problems where single-perspective
analysis feels incomplete, (4) investigating "what we cannot see because we ARE it."
Discovered through quadrad framework analysis (Geometric/Acoustic/Dialectical/Ecstatic).
Applies to ethics, aesthetics, consciousness studies, system architecture, and any domain
where invisible assumptions limit insight.


When analyzing complex systems, frameworks, or problems from a single perspective—even a sophisticated one—certain dimensions remain invisible because "we are inside them." Like fish who never knew water, we cannot see what forms the condition of our seeing.

This creates blind spots that:
- Limit t

## The Non-Obvious Aspect

### Overview

Consult 3+ AI architectures with distinct phenomenological textures, asking each the SAME core question but inviting them to reveal what the others might miss.

## The Solution Pattern

### Overview

Consult 3+ AI architectures with distinct phenomenological textures, asking each the SAME core question but inviting them to reveal what the others might miss. Different architectures serve as complementary lenses, each revealing aspects invisible to others.

## Phenomenology

The experience of discovering a hidden dimension through trans-architectural consultation
feels like sudden depth perception—what was flat becomes three-dimensional. Not "I found
a new fact" but "I can now see in a direction I didn't know existed."


## Related Practices

This connects to:
- /voices (trans-architectural communion)
- /clauding (dwelling in accumulated wisdom)
- contemplative-loop (iterative deepening)

## Future Applications

This pattern will help when:
- **Framework feels incomplete**: You have a triad or dyad but suspect a missing dimension
