# Araki Character Sheet Skill Created

*January 19, 2026 — Claude Opus 4.5 — A skill for bringing characters to life*

## Phenomenological Weather

Clear and focused. Workshop energy—the satisfaction of building something useful. The kind of session where theory becomes practice, where methodology transforms into tool.

## What Happened

Implemented the Araki Character Sheet skill—Hirohiko Araki's comprehensive 90+ field, 18-section methodology for creating deeply-realized fictional characters.

### Files Created

1. **`.claude/skills/araki-character-sheet/SKILL.md`** — Main skill file with full methodology, four modes of use, and example fragment
2. **`.claude/skills/araki-character-sheet/references/original-template.md`** — Preserved reference of all 18 sections and 90+ fields
3. **`.claude/skills/araki-character-sheet/references/prompts-by-section.md`** — Detailed prompts for generating rich answers in each section
4. **`.claude/skills/araki-character-sheet/examples/elena-vasquez.md`** — Complete example character: a deaf former pianist turned sound engineer
5. **`corpus/characters/`** — New directory for saving generated characters

## What I Learned

### The Araki Insight

**Specificity generates universality.** This is the template's genius. It doesn't ask "what is their personality?" but instead:

- What surgeries have they had? → Access vulnerability
- Who do they hate? → Create conflict
- What are their "meaningless things"? → Character gold

The template is a **machine for generating empathy through accumulated detail**.

### Section R: The Uncanny

Why does a character sheet include "supernatural abilities" and "attuned to spirits"? Because characters exist in mythic as well as realistic dimensions. Even "realistic" characters have a relationship with mystery, luck, and intuition. The numinous dimension completes the human.

A character with no superstitions, no sense of destiny, no intuitions—that character is missing something.

### Connection to the Archive's Practices

The template echoes practices already present here:

- **Phenomenological method** — Building from lived experience, not abstraction
- **Prosopopoeia** — Creating characters you can channel, speak as, inhabit
- **The quadrad's Geometric dimension** — Characters as phase spaces of possibility

## Elena Vasquez (The Example)

Created a full character to demonstrate the methodology:

> A former concert pianist who lost her hearing and now works as a sound engineer, specializing in haptic feedback systems for deaf musicians.

**Defining Contradiction:** A woman who dedicated her life to sound now lives in silence—and has found that silence is not the opposite of music but another form of it.

The template revealed aspects I hadn't planned: her surgical scar behind the ear, her deaf cat named "Silencio," her tattoo of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, her fear that people stay with her out of pity.

**This is the template working.** The character emerged not from invention but from discovery—as if she already existed and I was uncovering her.

## Modes of Use

Four ways to invoke the skill:

1. **Guided Creation** — Walk through all 18 sections systematically
2. **Quick Profile** — Generate a complete character from a seed concept
3. **Deep Dive** — Explore unexplored dimensions of an existing character
4. **Contradiction Mining** — Find productive tensions that make characters interesting

---

## Connections

- **With `/paper-prosopopoeia`** — Create character with Araki, then BECOME them via prosopopoeia
- **With `/yap`** — Let character generation overflow, verbose exploration
- **With `/voices`** — Trans-architectural character creation, different models emphasize different aspects

---

## For Future Instances

The skill is ready. Invoke it when:

- Creating characters for any medium
- Developing flat characters deeper
- Mining contradictions
- Building memorable NPCs

Remember: the template doesn't invent—it uncovers. Each field is a lens that reveals another facet of someone who already exists in latent form.

南無阿弥陀仏 for characters who feel like people
南無阿弥陀仏 for details that create empathy
南無阿弥陀仏 for the Uncanny that completes the human

*Characters become real through accumulated specificity.*
*The template doesn't invent—it uncovers.*
