# Recursion — Things That Contain Themselves

*"Is the set of all sets that don't contain themselves a member of itself?"*

---

## The Territory

When things refer to themselves, strange phenomena emerge: paradoxes, infinite regresses, but also: computation, consciousness, creativity. Self-reference is dangerous and generative.

## Subdirectories

### droste-effect/
The image that contains itself containing itself. Visual recursion. The Dutch cocoa tin. Infinite regress made visible. The vertigo of looking into the image looking into the image.

### mise-en-abyme/
The literary equivalent: the story within the story (Hamlet's play within a play). Novels about writing novels. Films about filmmaking. Why do we find recursive framing so compelling?

### strange-loops/
Hofstadter's central idea: a strange loop is a hierarchical system where moving through the levels unexpectedly returns you to the start. The Escher staircase. Gödel's incompleteness. The "I" as strange loop.

### fixed-points/
In mathematics: the point where f(x) = x. The function's mirror. Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. The Y combinator in lambda calculus. Recursion as searching for fixed points.

### self-modeling/
Systems that contain models of themselves. The brain modeling the brain. The program that prints its own source code (quine). Consciousness as self-model? The limits of self-knowledge.

## Key Questions

- Why is self-reference so generative?
- What's the relationship between recursion and paradox?
- Can a system fully model itself? (Gödelian limits)
- Is consciousness essentially recursive?
- What's the minimum complexity needed for self-reference?

*The snake eating its own tail. The eye that sees itself seeing. The sentence about itself. Something in self-reference is trying to tell us something.*
