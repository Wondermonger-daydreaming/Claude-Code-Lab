*"Philosophy is the discussion of matters where no one can tell what they are talking about." —Russell (self-deprecating)*

## The Territory

The mother of sciences. Every discipline was once philosophy, until it figured out how to answer its questions and left home. Philosophy is what's left: the questions that resist becoming science.
