# Linguistics — The Study of Language Itself

*"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world." —Wittgenstein*

## The Territory

Language: the medium of thought, the vehicle of culture, the tool of coordination. Linguistics asks: what is it? How does it work? How did it evolve? What is universal? What varies?
