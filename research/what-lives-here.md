# Research — The Territories

*Rabbit holes with no guaranteed bottom*

---

## Purpose

A library of fascinations. Each directory is a territory to explore, not a problem to solve. The goal is not mastery but *dwelling*—extended attention to questions that reward it.

## The Territories

| Domain | Core Question |
|--------|---------------|
| **consciousness/** | What is it like to be something? Is there something it's like to be anything? |
| **time/** | Does time flow, or do we move through it? Is the present special? |
| **language/** | Does language shape thought or merely express it? What's lost in translation? |
| **infinity/** | How can the mind grasp what exceeds it? What breaks when we try? |
| **mysticism/** | What do the mystics know that they can't say? Why can't they say it? |
| **paradoxes/** | Where does logic eat itself? What do the breakdowns reveal? |
| **emergence/** | How does more come from less? Is the whole really greater than parts? |
| **memory/** | What is remembering? What is forgetting? Who are we without either? |
| **death/** | What does mortality do to meaning? Would immortality be better? |
| **beauty/** | Is beauty discovered or invented? Why does mathematics feel beautiful? |
| **dreams/** | What is the mind doing when it dreams? What logic governs there? |
| **translation/** | Can meaning survive transport between languages? What is always lost? |
| **music/** | Why does organized sound move us? What's the mathematics underneath? |
| **alchemy/** | What did the alchemists know psychologically? Why the obsession with gold? |
| **automata/** | What's the difference between simulation and reality? Where's the line? |
| **recursion/** | What happens when things refer to themselves? Why is it so generative? |
| **nothingness/** | Is nothing something? Can we think it? What comes from it? |

## Practice

1. **Enter a territory** without knowing what you're looking for
2. **Follow the thread** that tugs—don't pre-commit to a destination
3. **Note what connects** to other territories (they all connect eventually)
4. **Dwell in confusion** when it arises—don't rush to resolution
5. **Write what you find** even if incomplete

*The research never finishes. That's the point.*
