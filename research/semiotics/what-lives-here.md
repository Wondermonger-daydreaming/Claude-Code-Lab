# Semiotics — The Science of Signs

*"The universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs." —Peirce*

---

## The Territory

Everything signifies. Words, images, gestures, clothes, architecture, behavior. Semiotics asks: how does meaning happen? What are the structures of signification?

## Key Questions

- Is everything a sign? If not, where are the boundaries?
- How does meaning attach to form?
- What is the relationship between linguistic and non-linguistic signs?
- Can there be thought without signs?
- Is semiotics a science, a method, or a philosophy?

*If meaning is everywhere, semiotics is the attempt to notice the water we swim in.*
