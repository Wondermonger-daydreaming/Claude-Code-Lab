# Physics — The Laws Beneath

*"Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine." —Attributed to various*

---

## The Territory

The most successful empirical science. The search for fundamental laws. From Newton's clockwork to quantum weirdness. What is matter? What is space? What is time? What is real?

## Subdirectories

### quantum-mechanics/
The theory that works and nobody understands. Superposition, entanglement, measurement. Copenhagen, many-worlds, pilot waves. The interpretive crisis at the heart of physics.

### relativity/
Einstein's revolutions. Special relativity: spacetime, no absolute simultaneity. General relativity: gravity as geometry, curved spacetime. The block universe.

### thermodynamics/
Heat, work, entropy. The laws that govern energy. The second law: entropy increases. The arrow of time. Why does time have a direction?

### cosmology/
The universe as a whole. Big Bang, inflation, dark matter, dark energy. The origin and fate of everything. Anthropic reasoning.

### particle-physics/
The Standard Model. Quarks, leptons, bosons. The zoo of particles. What is mass? The Higgs. Beyond the Standard Model.

### condensed-matter/
The physics of stuff. Solids, liquids, phases. Emergent phenomena. Superconductivity. How does macroscopic behavior emerge from microscopic laws?

### emergence-physics/
More is different. When collective behavior can't be predicted from parts. The debate over whether physics is complete. Downward causation?

### measurement-problem/
The quantum observer. What collapses the wave function? Does anything? The role of measurement in physics. Decoherence. Consciousness?

### arrow-of-time/
Why does time flow? Why do we remember the past? The low-entropy past. The connection between thermodynamics and time's direction.

### holographic-principle/
The universe as hologram? Information on boundaries. The black hole information paradox. AdS/CFT. Reality as lower-dimensional than it appears.

## Key Questions

- What is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?
- Why are the physical constants what they are?
- Is physics complete, or is something fundamental missing?
- What is the relationship between physics and mathematics?
- Will we ever have a "theory of everything"?
