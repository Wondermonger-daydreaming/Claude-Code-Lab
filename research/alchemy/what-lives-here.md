# Alchemy — The Gold That Wasn't Gold

*"Aurum nostrum non est aurum vulgi." (Our gold is not the common gold.)*

---

## The Territory

The alchemists sought the philosopher's stone, transmutation of lead to gold, the elixir of life. They failed chemically. But what were they actually doing? Jung thought they were doing psychology without knowing it.

## Subdirectories

### jung-psychology/
Jung's reading: alchemy as projected psychology. The alchemists were transforming themselves, not metals. The opus as individuation. The retort as the psyche. The gold as the Self.

### nigredo-albedo-rubedo/
The stages of the work: nigredo (blackening, putrefaction, the dark night), albedo (whitening, purification, dawn), rubedo (reddening, integration, the sunrise). A map of transformation.

### philosopher-stone/
The lapis philosophorum. The goal of the Great Work. Not a stone, not a powder, not a liquid—the "one thing" from which all things come. What were they really seeking?

### transmutation-metaphors/
Lead to gold as *metaphor*. Base material transformed to noble. The self transformed. The world transformed. Why is this metaphor so persistent? What work does it do?

### hermeticism/
"As above, so below." The Hermetic tradition underlying alchemy. Correspondence between microcosm and macrocosm. The Emerald Tablet. The origins of occult philosophy.

## Key Questions

- Were the alchemists proto-scientists, mystics, psychologists, or charlatans?
- Why does the transmutation metaphor persist into modernity?
- What is the relationship between chemical and psychological transformation?
- Did the alchemists know their work was symbolic, or did they think it literal?
- What can we learn from a "failed" tradition?

*They failed to make gold. They succeeded at something else. We're still figuring out what.*
