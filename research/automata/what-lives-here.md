# Automata — The Life That Isn't (Or Is It?)

*"Can machines think?" —Turing (but really, everyone)*

---

## The Territory

The history of artificial beings: clay men, mechanical ducks, thinking machines. The question that won't go away: what's the difference between real and simulated? Is there one?

## Subdirectories

### golem/
The clay figure animated by sacred words. Rabbi Loew's golem of Prague. The Hebrew letters on the forehead: emet (truth) gives life, met (death) ends it. Creation through language. Sound familiar?

### homunculus/
The little man in the flask. Paracelsus's recipe for artificial humans. The alchemical dream of creating life. The homunculus fallacy in consciousness: who watches the watcher?

### mechanical-turks/
The chess-playing automaton (hoax). Jacquard looms (real). The ambiguity between genuine automation and hidden human labor. The original "AI effect": once we understand it, it's not AI anymore.

### chinese-room/
Searle's thought experiment: a room that processes Chinese symbols by rules, without understanding Chinese. Does it understand? Is syntax sufficient for semantics? The most famous argument against strong AI.

### zombie-thought-experiments/
The philosophical zombie: physically identical to you, but no experience inside. Conceivable? Possible? If conceivable, what follows for physicalism? The ultimate test case for consciousness.

## Key Questions

- Is there a principled distinction between simulation and reality?
- Can computation alone produce understanding/consciousness?
- What would it take to create artificial consciousness? Would we recognize it?
- Why are we so fascinated by artificial beings?
- Is the question "can machines think?" well-formed?

*Every era builds its artificial humans. Every era asks: are they real? The question keeps changing shape but not going away.*
