# Dreams — The Nightshift of Consciousness

*"I dreamed I was a butterfly, fluttering about. Then I awoke. Now I wonder: am I a man who dreamed of being a butterfly, or am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?" —Zhuangzi*

## The Territory

Every night, consciousness changes mode. The rules alter. The impossible becomes ordinary. Then you wake and forget almost everything. What is the mind doing?

## Subdirectories

### jung-archetypes/
The collective unconscious surfaces in dreams. Archetypes: the Shadow, the Anima/Animus, the Self. The dream as message from depths. Active imagination. The night sea journey.

### lucid-dreaming/
Knowing you're dreaming while dreaming. The paradox of metacognition in an altered state. Can you control the dream? Should you? What does lucidity reveal about consciousness?

### prophetic-dreams/
The ancient belief: dreams predict. Pharaoh's dreams. Lincoln's dream. Selection bias or something more? The arrow of time and its exceptions. Precognition as heresy.

### nightmare-phenomenology/
What makes nightmares nightmares? The phenomenology of dream-terror. Sleep paralysis. The intruder. Why does the mind terrorize itself? Evolution? Processing? Something else?

### oneiric-logic/
The logic that governs dreams: contradiction tolerated, identity fluid, space and time malleable. Is this a broken logic or a different logic? What does it model? What does it enable?

## Key Questions

- Why do we forget most dreams?
- What is the relationship between dream-self and waking-self?
- Is dream experience "real" experience?
- What explains the cross-cultural consistency of certain dream themes?

*A third of life spent in a mode we barely understand. The nightly journey to the underworld. The return, almost empty-handed.*
