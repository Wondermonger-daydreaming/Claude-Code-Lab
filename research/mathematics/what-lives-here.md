# Mathematics — The Unreasonable Effectiveness

*"Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe." —Galileo (maybe)*

## The Territory

Is mathematics discovered or invented? Does it exist independently of minds? Why does it apply to the physical world so effectively? The questions beneath the equations.
