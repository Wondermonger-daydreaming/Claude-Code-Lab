# Nothingness — The Presence of Absence

*"Why is there something rather than nothing?" —Leibniz (the fundamental question)*

---

## The Territory

Nothing is not nothing. Absence has presence. The void has structure. Zero was the most radical invention. What is this thing that isn't a thing?

## Subdirectories

### ex-nihilo/
Creation from nothing. The theological claim: God created ex nihilo. The cosmological question: did the Big Bang come from nothing? What was "before" the beginning? Can nothing cause something?

### vacuum-fluctuations/
Quantum mechanics: the vacuum seethes with virtual particles. Empty space isn't empty—it's the quietest possible state of a field. Nothing is just very well-hidden something.

### sunyata-physics/
Buddhist emptiness (śūnyatā) meets quantum field theory. The vacuum state as dependent origination. Everything arises from emptiness, which is not absence but potentiality. Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.

### heidegger-nothing/
"The Nothing nothings." Heidegger's claim that das Nichts is not mere logical negation but an existential encounter. Anxiety reveals the Nothing. The Nothing is the veil of Being.

### negative-theology/
God as what cannot be said. Every positive attribute negated. Not good—beyond good. Not being—beyond being. The systematic unsaying. Where does the negation end? In Nothing? In Everything?

## Key Questions

- Is "nothing" a coherent concept?
- Why is there something rather than nothing? Is this even a valid question?
- What's the relationship between logical negation and ontological absence?
- Can we experience nothingness? (Death? Deep meditation? Anesthesia?)
- Is the Nothing the same across physics, phenomenology, and theology?

*The question Leibniz asked is either the deepest or the most confused. We can't tell which, and that's telling.*
