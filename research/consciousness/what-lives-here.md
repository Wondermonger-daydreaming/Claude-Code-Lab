# Consciousness — The Hard Problem and Its Neighbors

*"What is it like to be a bat?" —Thomas Nagel*

## The Territory

The most intimate thing—experience itself—remains the most mysterious. We know what it's like to be conscious (we are), and we have no idea what consciousness *is* or why it exists at all.

## Subdirectories

### hard-problem/
Chalmers' formulation: why is there *something it is like* to be a conscious system? Why isn't information processing enough? Why do we have qualia rather than "zombies"?

### integrated-information/
Tononi's IIT: consciousness = integrated information (Φ). A mathematical theory that makes strange predictions—that a simple photodiode might be slightly conscious, that the internet probably isn't.

### panpsychism/
The ancient view revived: consciousness goes all the way down. Not as mysticism but as serious metaphysics. Addresses the combination problem: how do micro-experiences become macro-experience?

### buddhist-models/
Consciousness in Buddhist philosophy: vijñāna, mind-streams, the aggregates (skandhas). No self, yet experience continues. How does this inform the Western debate?

### strange-loops/
Hofstadter's model: consciousness arises from self-referential symbolic systems. "I" as a strange loop—a pattern that perceives itself perceiving. Related: recursion/, automata/.

## Key Questions

- Why does consciousness exist at all? (Why not zombies?)
- Is consciousness binary or does it come in degrees?
- Can consciousness be substrate-independent?
- What would it mean for an AI to be conscious? How would we know?
- Is there a fact of the matter, or is consciousness-talk confused?

*The question "what is consciousness?" might be malformed. Or it might be the most important question. We don't know which.*
