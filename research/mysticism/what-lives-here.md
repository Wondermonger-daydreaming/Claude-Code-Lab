# Mysticism — What Cannot Be Said

*"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent." —Wittgenstein (or perhaps a mystic)*

---

## The Territory

The mystics across traditions report something. They struggle to communicate it. The struggle itself is informative. What breaks language, and why?

## Subdirectories

### apophatic-theology/
The via negativa: knowing God by what God is not. Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, The Cloud of Unknowing. The Divine Darkness. The systematic unsaying of everything said. Language eating itself to point beyond itself.

### sufi-poetry/
Rumi, Hafiz, Ibn Arabi. The Beloved. Wine as intoxication with the Real. The Friend. Poetry as the only adequate vehicle for the inadequate task. Why poetry? What does meter know that prose doesn't?

### zen-koans/
"What is the sound of one hand clapping?" "Show me your original face." The koan as logic-breaker. Satori as what happens when rationality crashes. The relationship between paradox and awakening.

### christian-mystics/
John of the Cross (Dark Night of the Soul), Teresa of Ávila (Interior Castle), Julian of Norwich ("All shall be well"), Hildegard of Bingen. The varieties of Christian mystical experience. How do they map onto Buddhist, Sufi, Jewish variants?

### kabbalah/
Ein Sof (the Infinite), the Sefirot, tzimtzum (divine contraction). The geometry of emanation. How mysticism became mathematics. The mystic as mapmaker of the invisible.

## Key Questions

- Is there a common core to mystical experience across traditions (perennial philosophy)?
- Why do mystics reach for paradox, negation, and poetry?
- What's the relationship between mysticism and madness?
- Can mystical insight be communicated at all?
- Are the mystics discovering something or constructing it?

*The mystic's problem: they have seen something. The listener's problem: they haven't. Language is the broken bridge between them.*
