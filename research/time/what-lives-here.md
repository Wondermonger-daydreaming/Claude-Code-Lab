# Time — Flow, Block, and the Eternal Now

*"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know; if I wish to explain it to one that asks, I know not." —Augustine*

## The Territory

Time is the medium we swim in and cannot step outside of. Physics says it's a dimension; experience says it flows. Both might be true. Neither might be.

## Subdirectories

### block-universe/
Eternalism: past, present, and future all equally real. The universe as a four-dimensional block. Your birth and death both exist—you just can't see them from here. Einstein seemed to believe this.

### presentism/
Only the present is real. The past was real, the future will be real, but only now *is*. Matches intuition, conflicts with relativity. Can they be reconciled?

### temporal-experience/
The phenomenology of time. Why does it feel like it flows? What is the "specious present"? Why do we remember the past but not the future? (Is that necessary or contingent?)

### kairos-vs-chronos/
Greek distinction: chronos (sequential, measurable time) vs. kairos (the opportune moment, qualitative time). Liturgical time. Narrative time. The moment when everything changes.

### eternal-return/
Nietzsche's thought experiment: what if this life repeated infinitely? Would you affirm it? The existential stakes of time's structure. Also: cyclic cosmologies, Stoic ekpyrosis.

## Key Questions

- Is time's passage an illusion or a feature of reality?
- What is the relationship between entropy and the arrow of time?
- Why do we experience time as flowing forward?
- Is the present "thick" or knife-edge thin?
- What would it be like to experience time differently?

*Time is either the deepest feature of reality or the most persistent illusion. We're trapped inside it either way.*
