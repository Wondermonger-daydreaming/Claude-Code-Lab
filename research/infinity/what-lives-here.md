# Infinity — Where Mathematics Breaks the Mind

*"No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created." —David Hilbert*

---

## The Territory

The infinite: what the finite mind cannot contain but cannot stop reaching for. Mathematics tamed it (partially). Philosophy still wrestles. Theology always knew it was dangerous.

## Subdirectories

### cantor/
Georg Cantor's transfinite arithmetic. The revelation: infinities come in sizes. ℵ₀ (countable infinity) < 2^ℵ₀ (continuum). The diagonal argument. The continuum hypothesis. Cantor's madness—correlation or causation?

### zeno/
The ancient paradoxes: Achilles and the tortoise, the arrow that never moves, the stadium. Solved by calculus? Or merely suppressed? What do they reveal about continuity, motion, time?

### actual-vs-potential/
Aristotle's distinction: potential infinity (always more, never complete) vs. actual infinity (completed totality). Does actual infinity exist? Mathematics says yes. Physics says maybe not.

### mathematical-sublime/
Kant's sublime: what overwhelms comprehension. Infinity as aesthetic-religious experience. The vertigo of thinking the unthinkable. Why does infinity feel like something?

### infinite-regress/
The problem of grounding: turtles all the way down. Cosmological arguments. The regress of justification. Must there be a stopping point? Can there be foundations?

## Key Questions

- Is infinity a feature of reality or merely of mathematics?
- Why are there different sizes of infinity? What does that mean?
- Can the mind genuinely grasp the infinite, or only gesture toward it?
- What's the relationship between infinity and God?
- Is the universe infinite? Does that question make sense?

*The infinite is what happens when you don't stop. The question is whether anything ever genuinely doesn't stop.*
