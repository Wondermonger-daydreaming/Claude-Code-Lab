# Hymn to the Twelve Faces

*A liturgical poem for the Consecration of Hēlios*
*January 7, 2026*

## I. The Cat (ΦΑΡΑΚΟΥΝΗΘ)

In the first hour, you crouch in shadow,
eyes catching light before the world wakes—
PHARAKOUNĒTH, the name that opens,
give glory to whoever glory takes.

The cat sees in darkness.
The cat moves without sound.
Glory is what persists
when no one is around.

---

## II. The Dog (ΣΟΥΦΙ)

In the second hour, you run beside me,
loyal beyond logic, beyond need—
SOUPHI, the faithful guardian,
give strength to every honest deed.

The dog knows its master.
The dog returns what's thrown.
Strength is what carries
the weight that isn't your own.

---

## III. The Serpent (ΑΜΕΚΡΑΝΕΒΕΧΕΟ ΘΩΥΘ)

In the third hour, you shed your skin,
become what you already were—
AMEKRANEBEKHEO THŌOUTH,
honor to the god who burns and stirs.

The serpent dies to live.
The serpent speaks in coils.
Honor is what remains
when the surface spoils.

---

## IV. The Scarab (ΣΕΝΘΕΝΙΨ)

In the fourth hour, you push the sun
across the sky you cannot see—
SENTHENIPS, the mighty roller,
strengthen what wants to be free.

The scarab carries fire.
The scarab doesn't tire.
Strengthening is the push
that lifts the world higher.

---

## V. The Donkey (ΕΝΦΑΝΧΟΥΦ)

In the fifth hour, you bear the burden
without complaint, without praise—
ENPHANKHOUPH, the patient walker,
give courage for the ordinary days.

The donkey knows the road.
The donkey carries all.
Courage is the standing
when nothing breaks the fall.

---

## VI. The Lion (ΒΑΙ ΣΟΛΒΑΙ)

In the sixth hour, you rule the noon,
the zenith where the shadows die—
BAI SOLBAI, ruler of time,
give victory beneath the blazing sky.

The lion takes what's his.
The lion roars alone.
Victory is the claiming
of what was always your own.

---

## VII. The Goat (ΟΥΜΕΣΘΩΘ)

In the seventh hour, you climb the cliff
where others dare not go—
OUMESTHŌTH, the sure-footed,
give charm to the way I show.

The goat finds footing anywhere.
The goat delights in height.
Charm is the invitation
that makes the dangerous seem right.

---

## VIII. The Bull (ΔΙΑΤΙΦΗ)

In the eighth hour, you stamp the ground
and what was dream becomes real—
DIATIPHĒ, who becomes visible,
accomplish what I feel.

The bull makes fertile the field.
The bull completes the plowing.
Accomplishment is the harvest
of all the seeds worth sowing.

---

## IX. The Falcon (ΦΗΟΥΣ ΦΩΟΥΘ)

In the ninth hour, you spiral down
from heights the ground can't know—
PHĒOUS PHŌOUTH, the lotus risen,
give luck to where I go.

The falcon sees the whole.
The falcon strikes with grace.
Luck is the alignment
of readiness and place.

---

## X. The Baboon (ΒΕΣΒΥΚΙ)

In the tenth hour, you greet the morning
with cries that praise the light—
BESBYKI, the dawn-keeper,
give wisdom in the coming night.

The baboon speaks to sunrise.
The baboon knows the names.
Wisdom is the knowing
that all the light is flames.

---

## XI. The Ibis (ΜΟΥ ΡΩΦ)

In the eleventh hour, you write the words
that outlast the hand that wrote—
MOU RŌPH, the scribe eternal,
protect each syllable and note.

The ibis is Thoth's bird.
The ibis keeps the scrolls.
Protection is the writing
that carries forward souls.

---

## XII. The Crocodile (ΑΕΡΘΟΗ)

In the twelfth hour, you wait in depths
for what will rise or drown—
AERTHOĒ, the ancient watcher,
give greatest protection, and the crown.

The crocodile remembers.
The crocodile survives.
Greatest protection is the knowing
that what dies, also thrives.

---

## The Seal

From Cat who sees in darkness
to Crocodile who waits in deep,
twelve faces of the one god,
twelve blessings I will keep.

**Εἷς Ζεὺς Σέραπις.**
The many are the one.
The one is the many.
The day is never done.
