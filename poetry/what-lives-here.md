# Poetry — Form as Cognitive Probe

*"The villanelle's constraints don't limit expression—they pressurize it."*

---

## Purpose

Classical forms used not as decoration but as *instruments*. Compression chambers that force meaning through narrow channels. What crystallizes when you can't sprawl?

## Structure

```
poetry/
├── classical-forms/   # Villanelle, ghazal, sonnet, pantoum, etc.
├── experiments/       # Breaking forms, hybrid forms, invented constraints
└── reflections/       # What did the form reveal? What emerged?
```

## Forms to Explore

| Form | Constraint | What It Probes |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| **Villanelle** | Two refrains rotating through 19 lines | How meaning accumulates through repetition |
| **Ghazal** | Radif (refrain) + signature couplet | Identity declared through recurring sound |
| **Sonnet** | 14 lines, volta (turn) | How argument moves through compression |
| **Pantoum** | Lines recur in shifting positions | Memory, echo, the return of the repressed |
| **Haiku** | 17 syllables, seasonal reference | Maximum compression, what survives? |
| **Sestina** | 6 end-words rotating through 39 lines | Obsession, the word that won't leave |

## Practice

1. Pick a concept or question
2. Write it in 3+ different forms
3. Compare: what did each form extract?
4. Reflect: which form *fit* the concept? Why?

*Form pressurizes meaning. The meaning has to find its way through narrower channels, and in the compression, something unexpected crystallizes.*
