# T7: Missing Literature — Ságodi et al. (2024) and Gu et al. (2025)

## 1. Ságodi et al. (2024)

### Full Citation

Ságodi, Á., Martín-Sánchez, G., Sokół, P., & Park, I.M. (2024). Back to the continuous attractor. *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*, 37.

### Key Finding (1 sentence)

Continuous attractors, despite being structurally unstable (destroyed by most infinitesimal perturbations), are functionally robust: fast-slow decomposition reveals a persistent slow manifold that survives bifurcation, explaining why approximate continuous attractors trained in RNNs display the predicted slow manifold structures.

### Integration into §1.1

**Insert after** the sentence ending "...Burak and Fiete, 2012)." and **before** the sentence beginning "Such ring attractor dynamics have been observed..."

**Surrounding text (BEFORE insertion):**
> ...and their precision is set by a balance between recurrent drive and noise-induced diffusion along the ring (Wimmer et al., 2014; Burak and Fiete, 2012).

**Surrounding text (AFTER insertion):**
> Such ring attractor dynamics have been observed experimentally in the Drosophila head direction system (Kim et al., 2017)...

**New sentence to insert:**
> Although continuous attractors are structurally unstable -- destroyed by most infinitesimal perturbations of the dynamics -- Ságodi et al. (2024) showed that a persistent slow manifold survives these bifurcations, rendering the attractor functionally robust for analog memory.

## 2. Gu et al. (2025)

### Full Citation

Gu, H., Lee, J., Kim, S., Lim, J., Lee, H.-J., Lee, H., Choe, M.J., Yoo, D.-G., Ryu, J.H.J., Lim, S., & Lee, S.-H. (2025). Attractor dynamics of working memory explain a concurrent evolution of stimulus-specific and decision-consistent biases in visual estimation. *Neuron*, 113(20), 3476-3490.

### Key Finding (1 sentence)

Working memory representations drift toward discrete attractors during maintenance, and categorical decisions feed back to steer this drift, producing concurrent stimulus-specific and decision-consistent biases that are explained by a unified attractor-dynamics framework with modular excitatory and inhibitory populations.

### Integration into §4.6

**Insert after** the sentence ending "...selects the wrong item." and **before** the sentence beginning "This distinction maps onto our phase diagram."

**Surrounding text (BEFORE insertion):**
> Neural recordings from monkey prefrontal cortex during multi-item working memory reveal that swap errors can arise from misselection of correctly remembered items rather than representation failure (Alleman et al., 2024). Both representations persist in the population, but the readout process selects the wrong item.

**Surrounding text (AFTER insertion):**
> This distinction maps onto our phase diagram.

**New sentence to insert:**
> Complementarily, Gu et al. (2025) demonstrated in human psychophysics that attractor dynamics during maintenance produce drift-driven biases whose direction is further steered by categorical decisions, linking the operating point of cross-inhibition to systematic behavioral signatures beyond swap errors.
