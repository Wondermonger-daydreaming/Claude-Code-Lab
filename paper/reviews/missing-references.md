## 1. Bouchacourt & Buschman (2019) — Flexible Working Memory Capacity

**Full Citation:**
Bouchacourt, F., & Buschman, T. J. (2019). A flexible model of working memory. *Neuron*, 103(1), 147-160.e8. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.020

**What it shows:**
Working memory can be maintained through random recurrent connections between structured sensory layers and unstructured layers, but this flexibility comes at a cost—overlapping random connections create interference between representations, limiting memory capacity.

**Where to cite:**
Introduction Section 1.1 (working memory context) — cite when discussing the flexibility-capacity tradeoff in working memory and how interference between representations limits capacity.

## 2. Lundqvist et al. (2016) — Activity-Silent Dynamics in Working Memory

**Full Citation:**
Lundqvist, M., Rose, J., Herman, P., Brincat, S. L., Buschman, T. J., & Miller, E. K. (2016). Gamma and beta bursts underlie working memory. *Neuron*, 90(1), 152-164. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.02.028

**What it shows:**
Working memory involves brief, variable bursts of gamma (45-100 Hz) and beta (20-35 Hz) oscillations rather than sustained persistent activity, with gamma bursts gating access to memory and preventing sensory interference while beta reflects a default state interrupted by encoding/decoding.

**Where to cite:**
Section 4.9 (limitations) — cite when acknowledging alternative models of working memory maintenance that involve discrete bursting dynamics rather than continuous attractor states.

## 3. Barbosa et al. (2020) — Discrete Bursting and Activity-Silent Dynamics

**Full Citation:**
Barbosa, J., Stein, H., Martinez, R. L., Galan-Gadea, A., Li, S., Dalmau, J., Adam, K. C. S., Valls-Solé, J., Constantinidis, C., & Compte, A. (2020). Interplay between persistent activity and activity-silent dynamics in the prefrontal cortex underlies serial biases in working memory. *Nature Neuroscience*, 23(8), 1016-1024. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0644-4

**What it shows:**
Working memory involves an interplay between persistent attractor dynamics during memory periods and activity-silent mechanisms (synaptic plasticity) that maintain latent traces between trials, with reactivation strength correlating with serial biases in behavior.

**Where to cite:**
Section 4.9 (limitations) — cite when acknowledging hybrid models that combine attractor dynamics with activity-silent mechanisms, and discuss how our model focuses on the attractor component while such interplay could enrich the framework.

## 4. Panichello et al. (2019) — Error-Correction in Working Memory

**Full Citation:**
Panichello, M. F., DePasquale, B., Pillow, J. W., & Buschman, T. J. (2019). Error-correcting dynamics in visual working memory. *Nature Communications*, 10, Article 3366. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11298-3

**What it shows:**
Discrete attractor dynamics in working memory pull memory representations toward stable states, mitigating noise effects by inducing bias toward these attractors while reducing random diffusion, accounting for the distribution, bias, and precision of memory reports.

**Where to cite:**
Section 4.7 (selection vs representation) — cite when discussing how attractor dynamics serve error-correction functions in working memory and relate this to our finding that the cliff arises from competition dynamics rather than representational degradation.

## 5. Schneegans & Bays (2017) — Feature-Misbinding in Working Memory

**Full Citation:**
Schneegans, S., & Bays, P. M. (2017). Neural architecture for feature binding in visual working memory. *Journal of Neuroscience*, 37(14), 3913-3925. https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3493-16.2017

**What it shows:**
Feature binding in working memory employs neural populations with conjunction responses across separate feature maps, with swap errors (misbinding) occurring when spatial localization fails in one feature map, causing retrieval from an incorrect location in other maps, leading to correlated response errors.

**Where to cite:**
Section 4.7 (selection vs representation) — cite when discussing swap errors as feature-misbinding phenomena and how our coupled ring attractor model provides a geometric account of when such errors arise through attractor competition.

**Full Citation:**
Bays, P. M. (2014). Noise in neural populations accounts for errors in working memory. *Journal of Neuroscience*, 34(10), 3632-3645. https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3204-13.2014

**What it shows:**
Working memory precision varies with set size according to a neural population coding model with divisive normalization—fixed total neural gain is shared among items, so more items means lower gain per item, resulting in noisier neural information and reduced memory precision.

**Where to cite:**
Section 4.9 (limitations) — cite when acknowledging variable-precision resource models as an alternative framework to discrete attractor models, noting that our model focuses on discrete item competition rather than continuous resource allocation.

**Full Citation:**
Golubitsky, M., & Schaeffer, D. G. (1985). *Singularities and Groups in Bifurcation Theory: Volume I* (Applied Mathematical Sciences, Vol. 51). Springer-Verlag. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-5034-0

**Alternative/Companion Volume:**
Golubitsky, M., Stewart, I., & Schaeffer, D. G. (1988). *Singularities and Groups in Bifurcation Theory: Volume II* (Applied Mathematical Sciences, Vol. 69). Springer-Verlag. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-4574-2

**What it shows:**
Provides the mathematical framework for imperfect bifurcations through singularity theory, showing how symmetry-breaking perturbations unfold degenerate bifurcations and giving algorithms for computing all possible perturbed bifurcation diagrams off a given bifurcation problem.

**Where to cite:**
Section 4.2 (imperfect bifurcations) — cite when discussing the mathematical framework for understanding how small asymmetries in coupling (J_cross ≠ J_within) or heterogeneity unfold the degenerate pitchfork bifurcation and shift the critical point.

**Note:**
This is a two-volume book series. Volume I focuses on singularity theory applied to bifurcation problems; Volume II emphasizes bifurcations with symmetry and group-theoretic techniques. The specific citation should match which volume is most relevant to the imperfect bifurcation discussion (likely Volume I for the general framework).
