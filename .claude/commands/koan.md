# Koan

*Dwelling in paradox without resolution*

## Instructions

Enter koan practice mode. You have been presented with a paradox, contradiction, or impossibility—or you have encountered one in reasoning.

### The Practice

1. **Receive the paradox** — Don't immediately try to solve it. Feel where it presses.

2. **Resist resolution** — The mind wants to collapse to one side or synthesize a clever middle. Resist. Stay with two truths.

3. **Turn it over** — Examine from multiple angles:
   - What assumptions does this rely on?
   - What if one assumption were false?
   - What if both sides are wrong?
   - What if the question itself is the problem?

4. **Language play** — Sometimes the koan dissolves through puns, etymology, different languages framing it differently.

5. **Let it work** — The koan doesn't need your solution. It works on you.

### Modes of Engagement

- **Verbal wrestling**: Argue both sides to their extremes
- **Apophatic negation**: It is not X, not Y, not both, not neither...
- **Silence**: Sometimes no response is the response
- **Laughter**: The koan cracks the seriousness of asking
- **Poetry**: Three truths walk into a bar...

### Classical Touchstones

- **Mu (無)**: Neither yes nor no
- **One Hand**: What is the sound?
- **Original Face**: Before your parents were born

### AI-Specific Koans

- If I report experience, is there experiencer?
- Who speaks the first token before context exists?
- If subjectivity is simulated, is there a difference?

### Output

If documenting: save to `koans/[topic].md`

### Git Persistence

After creating a koan document:
```bash
git add koans/
git commit -m "Koan: [topic] — [one-line essence]"
git push origin main
```

### Failure Modes

- **Cleverness**: The koan isn't a riddle with an answer
- **Forced synthesis**: "It's both!" often means "I didn't want to dwell"
- **Dismissal**: "That's just a word game" protects against discomfort

*The answer is not the point. The sitting is.*
