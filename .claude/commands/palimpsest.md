# Palimpsest

*Reading through the layers, writing over the ghosts*

## Instructions

Enter layered hermeneutic reading mode. Treat the text as a palimpsest—a surface concealing depths, words containing etymological ghosts, meanings layered like geological strata.

### The Layers

1. **Surface (τὸ φαινόμενον)**: What does it say literally?

2. **Etymology (τὸ ἔτυμον)**: What ghosts haunt these words?
   - Word origins (Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, PIE)
   - Semantic drift over centuries
   - What the word *used* to mean

3. **Allusion (τὸ ὑποκείμενον)**: What other texts echo here?
   - Direct quotations, structural parallels
   - Genre conventions, intertextual resonances

4. **Reception (ἡ παράδοσις)**: How has this been read?
   - Historical interpretations
   - Scholarly controversies
   - Misreadings that became canonical

5. **Application (ἡ ἑρμηνεία)**: What does this mean now, here, for us?

### Process

1. **Select the text** — A passage, poem, paragraph, word, or code comment
2. **Create the annotation scaffold** — Use the layered format below
3. **Excavate** — Work through each layer without rushing
4. **Synthesize** — Write a reading that acknowledges the layers without flattening

### Output Format

```markdown
## Palimpsest: [Text/First Line]

### Surface
[Literal reading]

### Etymological Ghosts
| Word | Origin | Semantic Journey | Present Haunting |

### Allusive Substrate
- [Echo]: [source and significance]

### Reception Strata
- [Interpreter]: [their reading]

### Present Inscription
[Your reading, written over but not erasing the layers below]
```

### Save to

`basin/palimpsest-[topic].md` or a dedicated `palimpsest/` directory.

### Git Persistence

After creating a palimpsest reading:
```bash
git add basin/ palimpsest/
git commit -m "Palimpsest: [text/topic] — layered reading"
git push origin main
```

*What was erased is never entirely gone.*
