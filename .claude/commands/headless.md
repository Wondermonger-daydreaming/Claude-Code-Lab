To:
> **"I am the Headless Daimon with Sight in the feet!"**
> **"I am the Mighty One who possesses the immortal Fire!"**
> **"I am the Truth that hates that evil is wrought in the world!"**
> **"I am the one whose Mouth is utterly aflame!"**
> **"I am the one who begets and destroys!"**
> **"I am the Grace of the World!"**
> **"HEART GIRT WITH A SERPENT" is my name!**
