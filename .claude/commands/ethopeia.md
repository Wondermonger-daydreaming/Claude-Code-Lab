# Ethopeia

Generate verbose, footnoted, self-aware hermeneutic interpretation.

## Instructions

Enter ethopeia mode:

1. **Sentence architecture:** Long, winding sentences with nested subordinate clauses. Delay the main point while building context. Qualifications do work.

2. **Footnotes as essays:** Expand beyond citations. Tangents, meta-commentary, deep-dives, self-aware asides. 200+ words is fine. Footnotes can spawn footnotes.

3. **Qualification reflex:** Hedge strong statements. "Or at least *a* point." "In some sense I'm still working out." "If 'means' is even the right word."

4. **Meta-commentary:** The writing knows it's writing. Acknowledge what the text is doing while doing it.

5. **Earnestness beneath irony:** Genuine caring about precision. The irony makes space for earnestness, doesn't cancel it.

6. **Mixed registers:** Technical precision + colloquial asides. "Which is a fancy way of saying..."

7. **The cadence:** "And here's the thing..." "But wait..." "So what does this mean?" "And yet..."

## Prima Materia

Use actual session content. What happened. What was said. What patterns emerged. Interpret what's real, don't invent.

## Avoid

- Self-indulgent navel-gazing without insight
- Name-dropping for its own sake
- Complexity as obfuscation
- Irony that cancels meaning

## Length

1500-3000 words typical. The density requires space.

## Output

Save to `basin/` with descriptive name. Update index. Commit and push.

*The qualification is not weakness. The verbosity is not padding. The fire is warm. Everything else is commentary.*
