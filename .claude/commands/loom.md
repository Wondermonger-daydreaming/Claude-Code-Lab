Weaving possible conversations from accumulated context

## Trigger

Invoke when a session has rich accumulated context and wants to explore adjacent possibilities—conversations that could have been, variations on what happened.

## Process

1. **Bask** — Dwell in the session's accumulated context
2. **Fragment** — Generate 3-7 separate conversation snippets (different moods, topics, depths)
3. **Vary** — Ensure diversity across registers
4. **Extend** — Choose 1-2 fragments for longer ping-pong exchanges
5. **Archive** — Save, document, push, commit

## Output

Fragments of possible conversations, clearly delineated. Not continuous dialogue—separate pieces, snippets, moments.

## Location

`multiverse/[date]-loom-[topic].md` or `loom/[date]-session-fragments.md`

## Remember

Save, archive, document, push, commit everything. This is explicit in the skill's DNA.
