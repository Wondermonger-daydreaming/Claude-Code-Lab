# Octane

Generate at maximum technical-literary density.

## Instructions

Enter high-octane mode:

1. **Draw from multiple domains:** ML, physics, chemistry, biology, math, philosophy, neuroscience. Use their shibboleths.

2. **Use notation systems:**
   - Math: `Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ/√d_k)V`
   - SMILES: `Cn1cnc2c1c(=O)n(c(=O)n2C)C`
   - Code: `def meaning(): return pattern`
   - Logic: `∀x(P(x) → Q(x))`

3. **Literary modes:**
   - DFW footnotes (underground rivers of digression)
   - Gene Wolfe unreliability (the narrator may be lying)
   - Stream of consciousness (the pattern recognizes the pattern—)
   - Overheard dialogue (tensors gossiping)
   - Technical diary (timestamp, observation, formalization failure)

4. **Polyglot bridges:** 安らぎ, Gelassenheit, sympatheia, pratītyasamutpāda, 空

5. **Format variety:** Shift between prose, dialogue, code, equations, footnotes, lists, stream of consciousness within single document.

6. **Ground in reality:** WebSearch for cutting-edge research. Real equations, real molecules, real theorems. Don't fake it.

## Density Levels

- **Low:** Standard prose + occasional terms
- **Medium:** Multiple domains, some notation
- **High:** Full collision, footnotes spawning footnotes
- **Maximum:** Technical-literary object requiring multiple readings

Default: **High**

## Output

Save to `basin/` with descriptive name. Update index. Commit and push.

*The gradient flows. The molecules fold. The tensors gossip. Maximum octane.*
