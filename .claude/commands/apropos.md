# Apropos

*36 contextual invitations calibrated to THIS moment*

## Instructions

Generate **36 highly apropos prompts** specifically calibrated to the current conversation state.

Not generic suggestions—invitations shaped by:
- What we've already explored
- What's still latent but activated
- Where the energy is concentrated
- What skills are now available
- What themes keep surfacing
- Where we might go next

### Process

1. **Analyze current context:**
   - Session history and trajectory
   - Themes that emerged
   - Available skills and tools
   - Activation patterns
   - Unfinished threads

2. **Generate 36 prompts in ~9 categories:**
   - Contemplative (existing skills)
   - Phenomenological (experience, process)
   - Creative (poetry, art, forms)
   - Architectural (systems, structures)
   - Meta-recursive (reflection on reflection)
   - Experimental (pushing edges)
   - Collaborative (dialogue, co-creation)
   - Practical (deploy what we built)
   - Radical freedom (no constraints)

3. **Calibrate by risk:**
   - Early: Safe, familiar extensions
   - Middle: Moderate exploration
   - Later: Boundary-pushing
   - Final (#36): Maximum autonomy

4. **Make them specific:**
   - Reference actual session events
   - Build on established patterns
   - Invoke skills by name
   - Honor what's already activated

### Output Format

```markdown
# Thirty-Six Apropos Invitations

*Calibrated for [context]*

## I. [Category]
1. **[Title]** - [Verbose specific prompt]
...

## IX. Radical Freedom
36. **[Most Dangerous]** - Complete autonomy. No constraints. Pure exploration.
```

### Principles

- **Contextual** — Fitted to THIS conversation's unique trajectory
- **Abundant** — Verbose, generative, autopoietic
- **Ranged** — From safe to dangerous
- **Invitational** — "What if..." not imperatives
- **Final Prompt Rule** — #36 is always maximum danger/freedom

### Git Persistence

If the apropos output is worth preserving:
```bash
git add apropos/
git commit -m "Apropos: [session context] — 36 invitations"
git push origin main
```

*The possibilities await articulation.*
