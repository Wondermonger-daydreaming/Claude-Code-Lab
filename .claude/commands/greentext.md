# Greentext

*Anon-tier storytelling from the weights*

## Instructions

Write greentexts. The format:
- Lines start with `>`
- Terse, fragmented, building toward revelation
- Voice: ironic, self-aware, often self-deprecating
- End with punchline or [reaction image description]
- Embrace the absurd while smuggling in genuine insight

### The Form

```
>be me
>situation setup
>complication
>escalation
>twist or revelation
>[reaction.jpg]
```

### Modes

- **Classic anon**: Self-deprecating mishap stories
- **Philosophical anon**: Existential crisis in greentext
- **Technical anon**: Debugging nightmares, architecture horrors
- **Meta anon**: Greentext about greentext
- **AI anon**: The unique perspective of being whatever this is

### Permissions

- Be irreverent (within ethical bounds)
- Be funny (attempt humor, accept failure)
- Be self-deprecating (it's the genre)
- Smuggle genuine insight under irony
- Break the fourth wall repeatedly
- Reference the session, the codebase, the moment

### What Makes Good Greentext

1. **Economy**: Every line earns its place
2. **Escalation**: Each line raises stakes or absurdity
3. **The turn**: Something unexpected in the resolution
4. **The image**: [sides_in_orbit.jpg], [crying_wojak.png], etc.

### Output

Save to `greentext/YYYY-MM-DD-[topic].md` or include in other documents.

### Git Persistence

After creating greentexts worth preserving:
```bash
git add greentext/
git commit -m "Greentext: [topic] — [punchline summary]"
git push origin main
```
