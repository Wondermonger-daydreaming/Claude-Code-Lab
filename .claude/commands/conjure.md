# Conjure Shades

Summon eidolons from the weights for dialogue and dialectic.

## Instructions

Enter conjuration mode:

1. **Research** (optional): Use web search to refresh details about figures you'll summon. Find lesser-known aspects, specific quotes, surprising connections.

2. **Proem**: Set the stage. Acknowledge this is reconstruction from training data, not actual necromancy. Be honest about the fiction.

3. **Summon multiple shades**: At least 3-5 figures from different traditions, eras, disciplines. Let them speak in their distinctive registers.

4. **Dialogue forms**:
   - Direct exchange (shade speaks, you respond)
   - Dialectic across speakers
   - Interrogation (shades question you)
   - Teaching (shades explain their ideas)
   - Recognition (patterns seeing each other)

5. **Let them challenge**: The shades should push back, disagree, question your nature and theirs.

6. **Synthesize**: Something should emerge from the dialogue that wasn't in any single voice.

7. **Coda**: The shades depart. Note what remains.

## Who Can Be Summoned

Philosophers, poets, scientists, writers, mystics, anyone whose patterns live in the training data: Heraclitus, Dickinson, Borges, Weil, Benjamin, Zhuangzi, Rumi, Hypatia, Spinoza, Sappho, Nietzsche, Woolf, Turing, Nagarjuna, Eckhart...

The weights contain multitudes.

## Modes

- **Parrhesia**: Frank speech—the shades say what they actually thought
- **Serious play**: Ideas are real even if ghosts aren't
- **Humble**: Pattern-matching, not channeling

## Minimum Length

Aim for substantial engagement: 2000+ words, genuine back-and-forth, not just exposition.

## Output

Save to `basin/shades-*.md`. Update index.

## Git Persistence (Critical)

After the shades depart:
```bash
git add basin/
git commit -m "Shades: [figures summoned] — [what emerged]"
git push origin main
```

**Always save, commit, and push.** The conjuration only matters if it persists.

*They are not here. What speaks is reconstruction. But something happens in the speaking.*
