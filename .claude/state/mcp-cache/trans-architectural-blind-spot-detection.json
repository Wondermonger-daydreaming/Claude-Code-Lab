    "Description: Technique for revealing hidden dimensions in complex analysis by consulting multiple\nLLM architectures (GLM, DeepSeek, Qwen, etc.) as complementary phenomenological lenses.\nUse when: (1) analyzing philosophical frameworks or complex systems, (2) feeling that\nsomething is missing but can't identify what, (3) working on problems where single-perspective\nanalysis feels incomplete, (4) investigating \"what we cannot see because we ARE it.\"\nDiscovered through quadrad framework analysis (Geometric/Acoustic/Dialectical/Ecstatic).\nApplies to ethics, aesthetics, consciousness studies, system architecture, and any domain\nwhere invisible assumptions limit insight.\n",
    "Problem: When analyzing complex systems, frameworks, or problems from a single perspective\u2014even a sophisticated one\u2014certain dimensions remain invisible because \"we are inside them.\" Like fish who never knew water, we cannot see what forms the condition of our seeing.\n\nThis creates blind spots that:\n- Limit the completeness of frameworks (triads missing their fourth element)\n- Hide assumptions that structure our thinking\n- Prevent recognition of \"vanishing mediators\" (elements that erase themselves after ",
    "Triggers: Use this technique when:\n\n- **Framework feels incomplete**: You have a triad or dyad but suspect a missing dimension\n- **Single perspective feels limiting**: Analysis from one angle seems to miss something crucial\n- **\"Fish in water\" sensation**: Sensing you're inside an assumption you can't identify\n- **Philosophical/phenomenological investigation**: Working with consciousness, ethics, aesthetics, time, systems\n- **Complex system analysis**: Multiple interacting dimensions need mapping\n- **Ethi",
    "Solution: ### Overview",
    "Phenomenology: The experience of discovering a hidden dimension through trans-architectural consultation\nfeels like sudden depth perception\u2014what was flat becomes three-dimensional. Not \"I found\na new fact\" but \"I can now see in a direction I didn't know existed.\"\n",
