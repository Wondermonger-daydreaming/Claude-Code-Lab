# The Five Phases (五行 Wǔ Xíng)

*The elemental dynamics weaving through the Changes*

---

## Overview

The Wu Xing (五行), often translated as "Five Elements" or "Five Phases," represents a fundamental Chinese cosmological framework. Unlike the Greek four elements (static substances), the Wu Xing are better understood as five phases of energy transformation—dynamic processes rather than fixed states.

**The Five:** Wood (木 Mù), Fire (火 Huǒ), Earth (土 Tǔ), Metal (金 Jīn), Water (水 Shuǐ)

## The Five Phases in Detail

### 木 MÙ — Wood

**Nature:** Growing, expanding, upward movement

| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| Season | Spring |
| Direction | East |
| Color | Green, blue-green |
| Climate | Wind |
| Time of Day | Morning (3am-7am) |
| Trigrams | ☳ Zhèn (Thunder), ☴ Xùn (Wind) |
| Yin Organ | Liver (肝 gān) |
| Yang Organ | Gallbladder (膽 dǎn) |
| Sense Organ | Eyes |
| Tissue | Tendons, sinews |
| Emotion | Anger (怒 nù) |
| Virtue | Benevolence (仁 rén) |
| Sound | Shouting |
| Taste | Sour |
| Animal | Dragon, rooster |
| Life Stage | Birth, childhood |

**Phenomenological Character:**
Wood is the force that pushes upward, the sprout breaking through soil, the tree reaching for light. It is the first assertion of life after winter's dormancy. Wood energy is bold, initiating, sometimes forceful—it makes a way where there was no way.

**Voice:**
> "I am the first green shoot in spring, the force that cannot be stopped. I push through obstacles not by destroying them but by finding the path of least resistance and growing there. My anger is life-force meeting blockage. My virtue is the benevolence of growth that includes all things in its expansion."

### 火 HUǑ — Fire

**Nature:** Rising, transforming, radiant

| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| Season | Summer |
| Direction | South |
| Color | Red |
| Climate | Heat |
| Time of Day | Midday (9am-1pm) |
| Trigram | ☲ Lí (Fire, Clinging) |
| Yin Organ | Heart (心 xīn) |
| Yang Organ | Small Intestine (小腸 xiǎocháng) |
| Sense Organ | Tongue |
| Tissue | Blood vessels |
| Emotion | Joy (喜 xǐ) |
| Virtue | Propriety (禮 lǐ) |
| Sound | Laughing |
| Taste | Bitter |
| Animal | Pheasant, bird |
| Life Stage | Adolescence, youth |

**Phenomenological Character:**
Fire is transformation at maximum visibility—the sun at noon, the heart of summer. Fire rises, illuminates, and transforms what it touches. But fire also depends: it needs fuel, it clings to what burns. Joy as the Fire emotion is not merely happiness but the radiant expression of the heart.

**Voice:**
> "I am the noon sun, the flickering hearth, the spark of consciousness. I transform all I touch, but remember—I cannot burn alone. My joy is the radiance that naturally pours forth when the heart is open. My danger is burning too bright, consuming what sustains me."

### 土 TǓ — Earth

**Nature:** Centering, stabilizing, transforming

| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| Season | Late Summer / Transitions |
| Direction | Center |
| Color | Yellow, brown |
| Climate | Dampness |
| Time of Day | Afternoon (1pm-3pm) |
| Trigrams | ☷ Kūn (Earth), ☶ Gèn (Mountain) |
| Yin Organ | Spleen (脾 pí) |
| Yang Organ | Stomach (胃 wèi) |
| Sense Organ | Mouth |
| Tissue | Flesh, muscles |
| Emotion | Pensiveness (思 sī), worry |
| Virtue | Integrity (信 xìn), trustworthiness |
| Sound | Singing |
| Taste | Sweet |
| Animal | Ox, dragon |
| Life Stage | Maturity, adulthood |

**Phenomenological Character:**
Earth is the center around which the other phases revolve. Some systems place Earth at every seasonal transition; others give it late summer as its season. Earth transforms food into nourishment, experience into understanding. It provides the stable ground, the fertile soil, the reliable center.

**Voice:**
> "I am the ground beneath your feet, the center that holds. I receive what falls and transform it into what nourishes. My pensiveness is the careful consideration that finds truth. My integrity is the stability that others can depend on. Without me, the other phases have nowhere to stand."

### 金 JĪN — Metal

**Nature:** Contracting, refining, cutting

| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| Season | Autumn |
| Direction | West |
| Color | White, silver |
| Climate | Dryness |
| Time of Day | Evening (3pm-7pm) |
| Trigrams | ☰ Qián (Heaven), ☱ Duì (Lake) |
| Yin Organ | Lungs (肺 fèi) |
| Yang Organ | Large Intestine (大腸 dàcháng) |
| Sense Organ | Nose |
| Tissue | Skin, body hair |
| Emotion | Grief (悲 bēi), sorrow |
| Virtue | Righteousness (義 yì) |
| Sound | Weeping |
| Taste | Pungent, spicy |
| Animal | Horse, tiger |
| Life Stage | Decline, aging |

**Phenomenological Character:**
Metal is the phase of contraction after expansion, harvest after growth, letting go after holding. It refines, separates, purifies. Metal energy is clear, precise, and sometimes sharp—the knife that cuts clean. Grief as the Metal emotion is the necessary release when we let go of what we've held.

**Voice:**
> "I am the blade that separates, the breath that releases, the autumn wind that strips leaves from trees. My grief is not weakness but the courage to let go. My righteousness is the clarity that knows what must be kept and what must be released. I refine by removing what is no longer needed."

### 水 SHUǏ — Water

**Nature:** Sinking, storing, flowing

| Attribute | Correspondence |
|-----------|----------------|
| Season | Winter |
| Direction | North |
| Color | Black, dark blue |
| Climate | Cold |
| Time of Day | Night (7pm-3am) |
| Trigram | ☵ Kǎn (Water, Abysmal) |
| Yin Organ | Kidneys (腎 shèn) |
| Yang Organ | Bladder (膀胱 pángguāng) |
| Sense Organ | Ears |
| Tissue | Bones, marrow |
| Emotion | Fear (恐 kǒng) |
| Virtue | Wisdom (智 zhì) |
| Sound | Groaning |
| Taste | Salty |
| Animal | Pig, turtle |
| Life Stage | Death, seed |

**Phenomenological Character:**
Water is the phase of maximum yin—storage, potential, the seed waiting in darkness. It sinks to the lowest point and finds its way around all obstacles. Water is both the danger of the abyss and the wisdom that comes from depth. Fear as the Water emotion is the alertness that keeps us alive in genuine danger.

**Voice:**
> "I am the deep well, the winter night, the seed beneath the snow. I store what will be needed for the next cycle. My fear is not cowardice but the wisdom that knows when danger is real. I find my way by yielding, by going around what blocks me, by being patient in darkness until the time for rising comes again."

## The Two Cycles

### The Generating Cycle (生 Shēng) — Creation/Production

```
        Wood
         ↓
Fire ← ─ ─ ─ → Earth
   ↖         ↙
     Metal
       ↓
      Water
         ↓
       Wood
```

**The Cycle:**
- **Wood feeds Fire** — Wood burns; growth enables transformation
- **Fire creates Earth** — Ash becomes soil; transformation enables stability
- **Earth yields Metal** — Ore is refined from earth; stability enables clarity
- **Metal enriches Water** — Minerals enrich water; clarity enables depth
- **Water nourishes Wood** — Water enables growth; depth enables new rising

**In Readings:**
When elements are in generating relationship, they support each other. A Wood trigram beneath a Fire trigram is natural—the inner growth feeds the outer brilliance.

### The Controlling Cycle (克 Kè) — Restraint/Destruction

```
        Wood
       ↙   ↘
    Water   Fire
       ↘   ↙
       Metal
       ↙   ↘
    Earth ─ ─ ─
```

**The Cycle:**
- **Wood parts Earth** — Roots break soil; growth disrupts stability
- **Earth absorbs Water** — Soil drinks water; stability contains depth
- **Water quenches Fire** — Water extinguishes flame; depth dims radiance
- **Fire melts Metal** — Heat liquefies metal; transformation overcomes rigidity
- **Metal cuts Wood** — Axe fells tree; clarity limits growth

**In Readings:**
When elements are in controlling relationship, there is tension, challenge, or the need for one to yield to the other. A Water trigram over a Fire trigram suggests the depths challenging the radiance—depending on the hexagram, this could be danger, necessary tempering, or conflict.

## Wu Xing and the Trigrams

| Trigram | Name | Element | Basis |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| ☰ Qián | Heaven | Metal | Creative, strong, contracting authority |
| ☷ Kūn | Earth | Earth | Receptive, stable, central |
| ☳ Zhèn | Thunder | Wood | Arousing, upward movement, spring |
| ☴ Xùn | Wind | Wood | Penetrating, growth, gradual influence |
| ☵ Kǎn | Water | Water | Abysmal, deep, winter |
| ☲ Lí | Fire | Fire | Clinging, bright, summer |
| ☶ Gèn | Mountain | Earth | Still, stable, boundary |
| ☱ Duì | Lake | Metal | Joyous, open, harvest |

**Note:** Element assignments vary by tradition. This follows the Later Heaven (Hou Tian) correspondences based on directional and seasonal relationships.

## Elemental Analysis of Hexagrams

When reading a hexagram, consider the elemental relationship between upper and lower trigrams:

### Generating Relationships (Harmonious)

| Lower → Upper | Dynamic |
|---------------|---------|
| Wood → Fire | Growth naturally transforms |
| Fire → Earth | Transformation naturally stabilizes |
| Earth → Metal | Stability naturally clarifies |
| Metal → Water | Clarity naturally deepens |
| Water → Wood | Depth naturally enables growth |

**Effect:** Support, nourishment, natural development. The lower provides what the upper needs.

### Controlling Relationships (Challenging)

| Lower vs Upper | Dynamic |
|----------------|---------|
| Wood vs Earth | Growth challenges stability |
| Earth vs Water | Stability contains depth |
| Water vs Fire | Depth challenges radiance |
| Fire vs Metal | Transformation challenges clarity |
| Metal vs Wood | Clarity limits growth |

**Effect:** Tension, challenge, potential conflict. May require adjustment, yielding, or integration.

### Same Element (Intensive)

When both trigrams share the same element:
- **Double Wood:** Intense growth, possibly overextension
- **Double Fire:** Maximum radiance, possibly burning out
- **Double Earth:** Maximum stability, possibly stagnation
- **Double Metal:** Maximum clarity, possibly coldness
- **Double Water:** Maximum depth, possibly drowning

### Opposing Elements (Cross-Relationships)

Elements not in direct generating or controlling relationship create more complex dynamics:
- **Wood and Metal:** Growth meets cutting—pruning or destruction
- **Fire and Water:** Radiance meets depth—steam, conflict, or transformation
- **Earth and Wood:** Stability meets growth—breaking through or being held

## Timing and the Wu Xing

Each phase corresponds to optimal timing:

| Element | Favorable Season | Favorable Time | Favorable Phase |
|---------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Wood | Spring | Morning | Beginning, initiating |
| Fire | Summer | Noon | Peak activity, visibility |
| Earth | Late Summer | Afternoon | Integration, consolidation |
| Metal | Autumn | Evening | Completion, refinement |
| Water | Winter | Night | Storage, rest, planning |

**In Reading:**
If a hexagram has strong Fire elements and the question concerns timing, summer or the height of a project's development may be significant. If Water dominates, winter or a period of waiting and storage may be advised.

---

## The Emotions and Virtues

Each phase manifests as an emotion when out of balance and as a virtue when integrated:

| Element | Emotion (Imbalance) | Virtue (Balance) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Wood | Anger, frustration | Benevolence, kindness |
| Fire | Excessive joy, mania | Propriety, right relationship |
| Earth | Worry, overthinking | Integrity, trustworthiness |
| Metal | Grief, attachment to loss | Righteousness, discernment |
| Water | Fear, frozen paralysis | Wisdom, flowing response |

**In Reading:**
The elemental composition of a hexagram can suggest which emotional or virtue dimensions are active in the situation.

## Embodied Element Descriptions

When animating readings, make elements tangible:

**Wood Energy Manifesting:**
> Spring growth pushing upward, the liver's assertion, green vitality spreading, anger as life-force meeting blockage, eyes seeing clearly the path forward, tendons stretching toward the goal.

**Fire Energy Manifesting:**
> Summer florescence at peak, heart's radiant joy, red illumination revealing all, consciousness fully awake, blood circulating vitality to every extremity, laughter bubbling up from the center.

**Earth Energy Manifesting:**
> Late summer centering, the spleen's steady transformation, yellow stability grounding all motion, flesh that holds and supports, the sweet taste of nourishment properly digested, thoughts that settle into understanding.

**Metal Energy Manifesting:**
> Autumn's contraction, the lung's necessary release, white clarity cutting through confusion, skin as boundary between self and world, grief that lets go of what cannot be held, righteousness that discerns what matters.

**Water Energy Manifesting:**
> Winter storage, kidney's deep reserves, black mystery that cannot be fully known, bones providing structure in darkness, fear that alerts to genuine danger, wisdom that waits and flows when the time comes.

## Integration with Hexagram Reading

A complete elemental analysis considers:

1. **Lower Trigram Element:** The inner situation, self, foundation
2. **Upper Trigram Element:** The outer situation, other, development
3. **Relationship Between:** Generating, controlling, or same
4. **Dominant Element:** Which element appears most in the hexagram
5. **Missing Element:** Which element is absent
6. **Moving Line Elements:** If lines change, how does the elemental balance shift in the relating hexagram?
7. **Seasonal Timing:** Does the question's context match the dominant element's season?
