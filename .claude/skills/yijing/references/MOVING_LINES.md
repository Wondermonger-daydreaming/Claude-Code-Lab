# Moving Lines (變爻 Biàn Yáo)

*The pivot points where situations transform*

---

## Overview

Moving lines are the dynamic element of I Ching divination. They represent lines at the extreme of their polarity—so full of yang they become yin, or so full of yin they become yang. These lines mark the specific points where the situation is transforming.

## The Four Line Values

When casting a hexagram, each line receives one of four values:

| Value | Name | Symbol | Nature | Probability (Yarrow) | Probability (Coins) |
|-------|------|--------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **6** | Old Yin (老陰) | ▬✕▬ or ○ | Changing yin → yang | 1/16 | 1/8 |
| **7** | Young Yang (少陽) | ▬▬▬ | Stable yang | 5/16 | 3/8 |
| **8** | Young Yin (少陰) | ▬ ▬ | Stable yin | 7/16 | 3/8 |
| **9** | Old Yang (老陽) | ▬●▬ or ⊗ | Changing yang → yin | 3/16 | 1/8 |

**Key Understanding:**
- **Young lines (7, 8)** are stable—they stay as they are
- **Old lines (6, 9)** are changing—they transform into their opposite

## How Moving Lines Create the Relating Hexagram

When old lines are present, they generate a second hexagram:

```
PRIMARY HEXAGRAM          RELATING HEXAGRAM
(本卦 běn guà)            (之卦 zhī guà)

   ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  (7)              ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
   ▬▬  ▬▬  (6) ───→          ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  (changed to yang)
   ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  (7)              ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
   ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  (9) ───→         ▬▬  ▬▬   (changed to yin)
   ▬▬  ▬▬  (8)              ▬▬  ▬▬
   ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬  (7)              ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
```

**The Narrative Arc:**
- Primary hexagram: The present situation
- Moving lines: The points of transformation, the crisis points
- Relating hexagram: Where the situation is heading, the outcome

## Line Position Significance

Each position (1-6, from bottom to top) carries specific meaning:

### Position 1 (初 Chū) — The Beginning

**Location:** Bottom of lower trigram
**Character:** Entry, inception, hidden potential
**Body:** Feet, foundation
**Society:** Commoner, the masses

**When line 1 moves:**
- Transformation at the root level
- Beginning of a new phase
- The seed point of change
- Often: wait, don't act yet; forces gathering

### Position 2 (二 Èr) — The Official / Minister

**Location:** Center of lower trigram
**Character:** Central, balanced, responsive
**Body:** Calves, legs
**Society:** Official, minister, aide

**When line 2 moves:**
- Internal adjustment, inner work
- Correct positioning; finding center
- Relationship with superiors
- Often: the "ruler" line for yin hexagrams

**Note:** Line 2 is considered the "ruler" in hexagrams with yin nature because it represents the responsive, devoted center.

### Position 3 (三 Sān) — The Threshold

**Location:** Top of lower trigram / transition zone
**Character:** Danger, difficulty, overextension
**Body:** Thighs, hips
**Society:** Transition between spheres

**When line 3 moves:**
- Threshold crossing, liminal space
- Danger of going too far
- Transition from inner to outer realm
- Often: caution required, difficult passage

### Position 4 (四 Sì) — The Near Minister

**Location:** Bottom of upper trigram
**Character:** Proximity to power, responsibility
**Body:** Trunk, chest
**Society:** Minister near the ruler

**When line 4 moves:**
- Relationship with authority
- Position of influence but not ultimate power
- Serving the greater while managing the lesser
- Often: act with humility and care

### Position 5 (五 Wǔ) — The Ruler

**Location:** Center of upper trigram
**Character:** Sovereign, central, commanding
**Body:** Shoulders, neck
**Society:** King, leader, sovereign

**When line 5 moves:**
- The decisive center of action
- Leadership transformation
- The pivot of the entire situation
- Often: the "ruler" line for yang hexagrams

**Note:** Line 5 is considered the "ruler" in hexagrams with yang nature because it represents the creative, initiating center at the height of activity.

### Position 6 (上 Shàng) — The Extreme / Sage

**Location:** Top of upper trigram
**Character:** Culmination, excess, withdrawal
**Body:** Head
**Society:** Retired sage, or one who has gone too far

**When line 6 moves:**
- Culmination reaching excess
- Time to withdraw or transition
- Wisdom from the heights (or warning of hubris)
- Often: ending of a cycle, preparation for new beginning

## Correct and Incorrect Position

Lines are "correct" (正 zhèng) or "incorrect" (不正 bù zhèng) based on their position:

**Correct Position:**
- Yang lines (▬▬▬) in odd positions (1, 3, 5)
- Yin lines (▬ ▬) in even positions (2, 4, 6)

**Incorrect Position:**
- Yang lines in even positions
- Yin lines in odd positions

**Significance:**
- Correct position: strength, stability, appropriateness
- Incorrect position: tension, challenge, need for adjustment

**Moving lines in incorrect positions** often suggest the tension driving the transformation—the line seeks its correct place.

---

## Correspondence Relationships

Lines "correspond" (應 yìng) when they relate across the two trigrams:

| Lower Line | Corresponds to | Upper Line |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Line 1 | ↔ | Line 4 |
| Line 2 | ↔ | Line 5 |
| Line 3 | ↔ | Line 6 |

**Strong Correspondence:** When one line is yang and its correspondent is yin (complementary)
**Weak Correspondence:** When both are the same (yang-yang or yin-yin)

**When corresponding lines both move:** The transformation involves both inner and outer realms, self and other, foundation and culmination.

---

## Central Lines (中 Zhōng)

Lines 2 and 5 are the "central" lines of their respective trigrams:

**Line 2:** Center of the lower (inner) trigram
**Line 5:** Center of the upper (outer) trigram

Central lines carry special weight because:
- They represent the balanced core
- They hold their trigram together
- They often serve as the "ruler" or most significant line

**When central lines move:** The core of the situation is transforming—not periphery but essence.

## Protocols for Multiple Moving Lines

Different traditions handle multiple moving lines differently:

### Traditional Method (Single Priority)

When multiple lines move, read the texts for all moving lines but emphasize:
- **Two moving lines:** Both are significant; read in sequence
- **Three moving lines:** The middle moving line dominates
- **Four moving lines:** The two that DON'T move are significant
- **Five moving lines:** The one that DOESN'T move dominates
- **All six moving lines:** Read the special "all lines changing" text if present, or focus on the transformation to the relating hexagram

### Chu Hsi's Method (朱熹法)

The Neo-Confucian master Zhu Xi (1130-1200) proposed:

| Moving Lines | How to Read |
|--------------|-------------|
| One moving | Read that line's text |
| Two moving | Read both; upper line is dominant |
| Three moving | Read the middle moving line |
| Four moving | Read the lower of the two static lines |
| Five moving | Read the single static line |
| Six moving | Read the hexagram judgment of relating hexagram |

### Integrative Method

For a full reading, consider:
1. **All moving line texts** for detailed guidance
2. **The sequence** from lowest to highest moving line as a narrative
3. **The transformation** from primary to relating hexagram as the arc
4. **Emphasis** on ruler lines (2 or 5) if they move

---

## Reading Moving Lines as Narrative

When multiple lines move, they tell a story:

```
Example: Hexagram 3 (Difficulty at Beginning) with lines 1 and 4 moving

Line 1: "Hesitation and hindrance. It furthers to remain persevering.
        It furthers to appoint helpers."

Line 4: "Horse and wagon part. Strive for union.
        To go brings good fortune. Everything acts to further."

Narrative: The beginning is difficult (line 1), and the querent must
wait and seek help. But as the situation develops (line 4), what was
separated comes together, and forward movement becomes favorable.
```

## Moving Lines and Time

Moving lines indicate not just WHAT changes but WHEN:

**Lower lines (1-3):** Closer in time, more immediate
**Upper lines (4-6):** Further in time, more eventual

**Line 1:** The very beginning, the seed
**Line 2:** The early stage, internal development
**Line 3:** The transition point, crisis of moving outward
**Line 4:** The early external phase, first contact with the world
**Line 5:** The mature phase, full development
**Line 6:** The completion or excess, ending or transcendence

---

## Phenomenological Approach to Moving Lines

When interpreting a moving line, consider:

### The Line as Actor
What force or tendency does this line represent?
- Yang moving: Active force reaching maximum, about to yield
- Yin moving: Receptive force reaching maximum, about to assert

### The Position as Stage
Where in the situation's development is this transformation occurring?
- Early (1-2): Foundation-level change
- Middle (3-4): Transition and relationship change
- Late (5-6): Culmination and completion change

### The Transformation as Plot Point
What happens when this force, at this stage, transforms?
- The tension that builds to breaking point
- The crisis that becomes opportunity
- The extreme that reverses
