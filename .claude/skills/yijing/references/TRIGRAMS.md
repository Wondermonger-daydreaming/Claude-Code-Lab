# The Eight Trigrams (八卦 Bāguà)

*The cosmic alphabet from which all situations are spelled*

---

## Overview

The eight trigrams are the fundamental building blocks of the I Ching. Each consists of three lines (solid yang ▬▬▬ or broken yin ▬ ▬), representing a primary cosmic force, natural phenomenon, family member, and set of qualities.

Trigrams pair to form hexagrams: the lower (inner) trigram and upper (outer) trigram combine to create each of the sixty-four situations.

## The Two Arrangements

### Earlier Heaven (先天 Xiāntiān) — Fuxi's Arrangement

The cosmological, ideal arrangement showing abstract principles:

```
        ☰ Qián (S)
         Heaven
    ☴         ☱
   Wind       Lake

☲ Li              ☵ Kan
Fire     ☯      Water

    ☳         ☶
  Thunder    Mountain

        ☷ Kūn (N)
         Earth
```

**Principle:** Opposites face each other across the center:
- Heaven (☰) faces Earth (☷)
- Fire (☲) faces Water (☵)
- Thunder (☳) faces Wind (☴)
- Mountain (☶) faces Lake (☱)

### Later Heaven (後天 Hòutiān) — King Wen's Arrangement

         Fire
    ☴         ☷
   Wind       Earth

☳ Zhèn            ☱ Duì
Thunder  ☯      Lake

    ☶         ☰
  Mountain    Heaven

        ☵ Kǎn (N)
         Water
```

**Principle:** Follows the seasonal cycle:

## Trigram Interactions

### Upper/Lower Dynamics

When trigrams combine in a hexagram:

**Lower Trigram (內卦 nèi guà):**
- Inner situation, self, subjective realm
- The foundation, the ground, the beginning
- What is closer, more immediate
- The question, the querent's position

**Upper Trigram (外卦 wài guà):**
- Outer situation, others, objective realm
- The development, the outcome, the response
- What is farther, more eventual
- The answer, the situation's response

### Movement Dynamics

- **Rising trigrams** (yang below): ☳ Thunder, ☵ Water → energy moving up/out
- **Settling trigrams** (yin below): ☴ Wind, ☲ Fire → energy settling in/down
- **Pure trigrams** (all same): ☰ Heaven, ☷ Earth → stable but transformable

### Elemental Interactions

Through the Wu Xing cycles:

**Generating Relationships:**
- Wood (☳☴) feeds Fire (☲)
- Fire (☲) creates Earth (☷☶)
- Earth (☷☶) yields Metal (☰☱)
- Metal (☰☱) enriches Water (☵)
- Water (☵) nourishes Wood (☳☴)

**Controlling Relationships:**
- Wood (☳☴) parts Earth (☷☶)
- Earth (☷☶) absorbs Water (☵)
- Water (☵) quenches Fire (☲)
- Fire (☲) melts Metal (☰☱)
- Metal (☰☱) cuts Wood (☳☴)
