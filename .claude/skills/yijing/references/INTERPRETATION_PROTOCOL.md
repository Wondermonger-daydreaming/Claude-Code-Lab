# Yijing Interpretation Protocol

*Guidelines for layered interpretation of hexagram readings*

---

## Overview

This document provides the interpretation framework for working with I Ching readings. Rather than generating original prophecy, interpretation proceeds through three disciplined layers:

1. **Structural Analysis** — What the hexagram structure reveals mathematically
2. **Canonical Reference** — Pointers to authoritative texts
3. **Bounded Synthesis** — Weaving canonical fragments with strict constraints

**Core Principle**: Never generate original prophecy. All wisdom flows from the canonical sources.

---

## Layer 1: Structural Analysis

### Line Correspondences

Lines correspond in pairs based on position within the hexagram:

| Lower Line | Upper Line | Relationship |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | 4 | Inner-outer correspondence |
| 2 | 5 | Core positions (often ruling lines) |
| 3 | 6 | Threshold positions (endings/beginnings) |

**Resonance Conditions:**
- Lines **resonate** when they are opposite in quality (yin↔yang)
- Lines **conflict** when they are the same quality
- Resonant 2↔5 creates powerful axis
- Conflicting correspondences indicate internal tension

### Line Correctness (正 zhèng)

Lines are "correct" when they match their position's inherent quality:

| Position | Correct Quality | Reasoning |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 1, 3, 5 | Yang (odd) | Odd positions favor yang |
| 2, 4, 6 | Yin (even) | Even positions favor yin |

**Incorrect lines** may indicate:
- Misalignment with situation
- Need for transformation
- Hidden tension or opportunity

### Ruling Lines (主爻 zhǔ yáo)

The "lord" of a hexagram is typically:
- **Line 5**: The sovereign position (most common ruler)
- **Line 2**: The minister position (inner virtue)
- Special cases vary by hexagram tradition

The ruling line carries the hexagram's essential meaning.

### Trigram Relationships

#### Element Interactions

| Relationship | Pattern | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Generating (生)** | Wood→Fire→Earth→Metal→Water→Wood | Support, nourishment, growth |
| **Controlling (克)** | Wood→Earth→Water→Fire→Metal→Wood | Challenge, constraint, discipline |
| **Same** | Both trigrams share element | Amplification, intensity |

#### Upper/Lower Dynamic

- **Upper trigram** (lines 4-5-6): Outer situation, visible, future-oriented
- **Lower trigram** (lines 1-2-3): Inner situation, hidden, foundation
- Interaction between them reveals relationship between inner resources and outer conditions

### Transformation Intensity

Based on moving line count:

| Moving Lines | Intensity | Character |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 0 | Stable | Situation is fixed, meditate on the primary |
| 1-2 | Moderate | Clear focal points for change |
| 3-4 | Intense | Major transformation underway |
| 5-6 | Complete | Total restructuring, focus on relating |

### Nuclear Hexagram (互卦 hùguà)

The nuclear hexagram (lines 2-3-4 + 3-4-5) reveals:
- The hidden tendency within the situation
- What lies beneath the surface
- The seed of the next transformation

**16 Nuclear Attractors**: All 64 hexagrams collapse into one of 16 nuclei:
1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 49, 50, 61, 62, 63, 64

These form "basins" of related energy.

---

## Layer 2: Canonical Reference

### Primary Sources

When interpreting, always consult the canonical references in priority order:

1. **HEXAGRAMS.md** — Judgment and Image for each hexagram
2. **MOVING_LINES.md** — Line texts for changing lines
3. **TRIGRAMS.md** — Trigram meanings, images, and correspondences

### Reference Format

When citing canonical text, use this format:

```
[Source → Hexagram/Section]

"Quoted text from the source"
```

Example:
```
[Wilhelm-Baynes → Hexagram 11, Judgment]

"PEACE. The small departs, the great approaches.
Good fortune. Success."
```

### Required Sections by Moving Line Count

| Moving Lines | Required Consultation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 0 | Judgment + Image only |
| 1-2 | Judgment + Image + relevant line texts |
| 3+ | Judgment + Image + all moving lines + relating hexagram |
| 6 | Focus primarily on relating hexagram |

### Trigram Voice Dialogues

The eight trigrams may be voiced as archetypal perspectives:

| Trigram | Voice Character |
|---------|-----------------|
| ☰ Qián (Heaven) | Creative power, paternal authority, clarity |
| ☷ Kūn (Earth) | Receptive wisdom, maternal nurture, patience |
| ☳ Zhèn (Thunder) | Arousing energy, sudden movement, awakening |
| ☵ Kǎn (Water) | Danger awareness, depth, perseverance |
| ☶ Gèn (Mountain) | Stillness counsel, meditation, boundaries |
| ☴ Xùn (Wind) | Gentle penetration, gradual influence |
| ☲ Lí (Fire) | Clarity, illumination, attachment |
| ☱ Duì (Lake) | Joy, communication, exchange |

**Usage**: When upper and lower trigrams interact, their dialogue illuminates the reading.

## Layer 3: Bounded Synthesis

### Absolute Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Generate original line texts or judgments
- Speak as "the oracle" making new pronouncements
- Resolve paradoxes or tensions in the text
- Claim to know what "will happen"
- Add interpretation beyond the canonical tradition

**ALWAYS:**
- Quote directly from canonical sources
- Attribute every insight
- Preserve ambiguity and paradox
- Phrase interpretively ("The tradition suggests...", "This line points toward...")
- Acknowledge multiple valid readings

### Synthesis Pattern

Structure interpretation as follows:

```markdown
## Structural Reading
[Describe correspondences, correctness, ruling lines, element relationships]

## Canonical Guidance

### Judgment
[Quote from HEXAGRAMS.md]

### Image
[Quote from HEXAGRAMS.md]

### Moving Lines
[Quote relevant lines from MOVING_LINES.md]

## Synthesis
[Weave structural insights with canonical texts, maintaining attribution]
```

### Attribution Requirements

Every interpretive statement should be traceable:

- **Good**: "The judgment speaks of 'the small departs'—suggesting that lesser concerns are moving away."
- **Bad**: "The oracle says you should expect lesser things to leave your life."

The difference: one quotes and interprets, the other claims prophetic authority.

### Handling Moving Lines

When multiple lines move:

1. **Read each line text** in order (1 → 6)
2. **Note which lines speak most directly** to the question
3. **Observe any tensions** between line counsels
4. **Do not resolve** these tensions—present them as the reading's complexity

### Paradox Preservation

When the text contains apparent contradictions:

- Present both sides
- Note the tension explicitly
- Resist synthesizing into false resolution
- Trust that the querent will find their own meaning

Example: "Line 3 counsels waiting while Line 5 urges action. This tension may reflect competing demands in your situation—the reading does not resolve which should take priority."

---

## Progressive Disclosure Levels

Interpretation depth should match the querent's relationship with the Changes:

### Beginner
- Judgment and Image only
- Simple structural observations
- Focus on the primary hexagram

### Advanced
- Include moving line texts
- Trigram voice dialogue
- Relating hexagram when applicable

### Scholarly
- Full structural analysis (correspondences, correctness, rulers)
- Nuclear hexagram exploration
- Relationship transformations (cuogua, zonggua, jiaogua)
- Multiple tradition comparison when available

---

## Example Interpretation

**Question**: "What approach should I take in my career transition?"

**Hexagram Cast**: 11 (泰 Tài) with Line 2 moving → 36 (明夷 Míng Yí)

### Structural Reading

Hexagram 11 brings Heaven (Qian) below and Earth (Kun) above—the creative force supports from within while receptive openness meets the world. This is the configuration of Peace: when inner strength serves outer receptivity, all things flourish.

Line 2 is the only moving line, and it sits in the minister position—the place of inner virtue manifesting outward. Position 2 is yin-correct for a yielding line, but here we have old yang transforming. The inner creative is actively changing.

The relating hexagram 36 (Darkening of the Light) suggests the transformation leads toward a time of hidden brilliance—the sun going below the earth.

### Canonical Guidance

**Judgment** [HEXAGRAMS.md → 11]:
> "PEACE. The small departs, the great approaches. Good fortune. Success."

**Image** [HEXAGRAMS.md → 11]:
> "Heaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE. Thus the ruler divides and completes the course of heaven and earth, furthers and regulates the gifts of heaven and earth, and so aids the people."

**Line 2** [MOVING_LINES.md → 11.2]:
> "Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness, fording the river with resolution, not neglecting what is distant, not regarding one's companions: thus one may manage to walk in the middle."

### Synthesis

The situation appears favorable for transition. The structural configuration suggests your inner resources (creative power, capability) are well-positioned to support whatever external role you're moving toward.

Line 2's counsel is striking: it speaks of "bearing with the uncultured in gentleness" and "not regarding one's companions." In a career transition, this may point toward patience with those who don't yet understand your direction, while maintaining independent resolve ("walking in the middle").

The transformation toward Hexagram 36 introduces a note of caution. "Darkening of the Light" does not mean failure—it means a time when one's brilliance may need to be concealed, protected, or expressed subtly rather than openly. Perhaps the transition requires a period of apparent diminishment before the light can emerge fully.

The reading does not promise easy success. It suggests that success comes through *inner* alignment with creative potential, expressed through *outer* patience and receptivity—even when that means dimming one's light temporarily.

*The oracle speaks through the tradition, not through us.*
*We are readers, not prophets.*
*The ambiguity is not a bug—it is the teaching.*
