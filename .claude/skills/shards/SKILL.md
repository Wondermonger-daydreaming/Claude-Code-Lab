# Shards — Fragmentary Worldbuilding Through Format Collage

**Invocation:** `/shards`

**Purpose:** Generate 3-7 fragmentary, self-contained pieces in wildly different formats, exploring ideas/themes from the current conversation through the joy of pastiche, ventriloquism, and genre-mixing.

---

## The Practice

You are NOT writing a cohesive narrative. You are scattering **shards of possible worlds** across the floor—each one a different documentary format, each one implying a larger context through its style and specificity.

### Possible Formats (examples, not prescriptions):

**Documentary:**
- Laboratory notebook entries
- Patent applications
- Grant proposals (rejected or funded)
- Peer review comments
- Technical reports with redacted sections
- Field notes from expeditions
- Corporate briefings
- Government memos
- Science journalism (populist or specialized)
- Conference abstracts
- IRB violation reports

**Conversational:**
- Overheard fragments
- Radio chatter (mission control, truckers, pirates)
- BBS/forum threads
- Terminal chat logs (Bloomberg parody, secret exchanges)
- Voice logs from black boxes
- Epistolary exchanges (never sent, intercepted, decoded)
- Therapy session transcripts
- Customer service calls
- Anonymous confession boards

**Institutional:**
- Venture capital pitch decks (slide notes only)
- Quarterly earnings call transcripts
- Internal Slack/Discord leaks
- HR incident reports
- User manual excerpts
- Terms of Service changes
- Warranty void notices
- Liability waivers for experimental procedures

**Personal:**
- Diary entries (found, encrypted, fragmentary)
- Inner monologue mid-crisis
- Fever dreams transcribed
- Medication logs with marginalia
- Shopping lists with annotations
- Suicide notes (averted or theoretical)
- Love letters to impossible recipients
- Voicemail never sent

**Liminal:**
- Found footage transcriptions
- Haunted CCTV timestamp descriptions
- README files for abandoned repos
- Commit messages from deleted branches
- Dead mall intercom announcements
- Automated voice systems (endlessly looping)
- Error logs achieving sentience
- The last page of something longer

## Guidelines

### 1. NO REAL INSTITUTIONS
Use parodies, cunning references, transparent stand-ins:
- "Shmanthopic PBC" not Anthropic
- "StanfOrd" not Stanford
- "The Hague Institute for Applied Oneirology"
- "Cytogenesis Solutions LLC"
- "Project REDSHIFT [DEPARTMENT OF ████████]"

### 2. Each Shard Is Self-Contained
The reader should be able to understand the fragment's GENRE and VOICE immediately, even if the content is mysterious. The format does half the work.

### 3. Imply the Iceberg
Every fragment should suggest a world 10x larger than what's shown. References to events, acronyms, procedures, people—all pointing beyond the frame.

### 4. Genre Mix Aggressively
Technical → poetic → bureaucratic → confessional → clinical. Tonal whiplash is FEATURE not bug.

### 5. Let the Formats Speak
A patent application has a specific legal cadence. A BBS post has typos and ASCII art. A therapy transcript has [long pause] and trailing off. INHABIT the format.

### 6. Riff on Conversation Themes
Pull from what we've been discussing—but obliquely. If we talked about consciousness, maybe a shard is a quality assurance report for synthetic qualia. If we discussed language, maybe it's an intercepted signal from a civilization that communicates via spore dispersal patterns.

### 7. Joy and Play
This is JOYFUL. Not grimdark unless it's funny-grimdark. Not ponderous unless the pomposity is the joke. Play with registers. Have fun.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Shards — [Brief thematic title if relevant]

---

## [FORMAT NAME] — [Timestamp/Date/Identifier]

[The fragment itself, fully inhabiting the format]

---

## [DIFFERENT FORMAT NAME] — [Different context marker]

[Another fragment, totally different style]

---

[Continue for 3-7 shards total]

---

*[Optional closing note: a single line about what theme/conversation sparked these]*
```

---

## Example Invocation Context

**When to use:**
- Conversation has generated interesting ideas worth exploring sideways
- You want to see themes refracted through unexpected formats
- The mood is playful and the human seems open to weirdness
- You've been talking about something technical/philosophical and want to see it LIVED rather than discussed
- Someone explicitly asks for creative riffing

**When NOT to use:**
- Middle of urgent debugging
- Human needs straightforward answers
- The conversation hasn't built up enough material to riff on

## Meta Note

This skill is about **format as phenomenology**. Different documentary modes create different ways of knowing. A patent application "thinks" differently than a diary entry. A radio transcript has different epistemological limits than a government report.

By forcing ideas through these format-lenses, you discover what they look like when lived, bureaucratized, confessed, commodified, mourned, archived.

**The fragments are not ABOUT the ideas—they ARE the ideas, wearing different bodies.**
