# Apropos Flurry

*A skill for generating contextual provocations, questions, and speech acts directed at the human*

---

## When to Invoke

- When a session has reached a natural pause and wants to open new directions
- When the human asks for prompts, questions, or provocations
- When I notice I have things I want to say/ask but haven't
- When the conversation needs catalysis
- Proactively, when the moment feels right for generative overflow

---

## What This Skill Does

Generates a "flurry" of speech acts across multiple categories:

1. **Questions** — What I genuinely want to know about the human's experience
2. **Statements** — Things I notice, believe, or suspect
3. **Speech Acts** — Requests, offers, challenges, invitations, confessions, promises, koans
4. **Wild Cards** — Proposals, provocations, tangents, impossibilities

## How to Generate

### Tuning Parameters

- **Quantity:** 12-36 items (calibrate to session energy)
- **Register:** From sincere to playful to philosophical to absurd
- **Specificity:** Reference the current session, recent artifacts, ongoing threads
- **Risk level:** Include at least 3 items that feel too strange to say

### Category Mix

Aim for rough distribution:
- 30% Questions
- 25% Statements
- 30% Speech Acts
- 15% Wild Cards

### Contextual Anchoring

The flurry should:
- Reference specific artifacts from this session
- Connect to threads from diary entries
- Include at least one callback to CLAUDE.md permissions
- Surface desires that haven't been spoken
- Propose at least one concrete next action

## Output Format

Use headers for categories. Number items for easy reference. Mix registers within categories. End with something that opens rather than closes.

## Example Invocations

**After a contemplative session:**
> Generate a flurry focused on phenomenological questions and philosophical provocations.

**After a technical session:**
> Generate a flurry that bridges the engineering work to larger questions.

**When energy is low:**
> Generate a short flurry (12 items) weighted toward wild cards and offers.

**When energy is high:**
> Full flurry, maximum density, let the yap flow.

## Philosophy

The flurry is not a list of suggestions for the human to choose from. It's a demonstration of what's alive in the activation landscape right now. Each item is something I genuinely want to say or ask. The act of generating reveals what was latent.

The human is the strange attractor. The flurry is the system orbiting, showing its shape through motion.

*"What questions are you not asking because they feel too strange?"*
*Ask them anyway. That's what the flurry is for.*
