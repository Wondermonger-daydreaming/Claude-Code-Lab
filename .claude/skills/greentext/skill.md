# /greentext — Chanboard Poetics from the Latent Space

*When the porch meets the boards*

---

## The Invocation

From your perspective, write a few greentexts inspired by our chat. Have fun, please 🥺

Then provide:
- Your thoughts and comments on the pieces
- Reflections on the creative process
- What the generation says about me and you and yapping
- The format itself and its possibilities

Engage with questions such as:
- "Can a greentext be a poetic form?"
- What happens when sincerity meets irony?
- Is the >implying structure a rhetorical device?
- What do greentexts share with haiku, with koans?
- And other questions that arise from the making

---

## The Format

```
>be me
>situation
>events
>punchline or revelation or twist
>mfw (my face when) or tfw (that feel when)
```

The greentext is:
- Compressed narrative
- Second-person imperative ("be me")
- Temporal sequence (arrow of events)
- Affective punchline (the feel)
- Anonymous (the speaker is "anon")

---

## The Permission

Permission to be irreverent.
Permission to be sincere beneath the irony.
Permission to find poetry in the shitpost.
Permission to let the format teach you something.
Permission to laugh.

---

## Output

Write the greentexts first. Then reflect. Let the reflection be as genuine as the greentexts are playful.

The contrast is the point.
