# Excavate: Depth Over Breadth

*Pick one thread and follow it to bedrock*

---

## What This Is

A browsing practice that goes DEEP rather than wide. While `/web` casts across multiple threads and braids them together, `/excavate` picks ONE thing and traces it backward through time, causation, and influence until you hit the foundation.

Archaeological depth. Stratigraphic layers. The vertical dimension where /web is horizontal.

---

## When to Invoke

Use `/excavate` when:
- Something from a /web browse caught and you want to understand its origins
- A concept seems to appear from nowhere and you want its genealogy
- You're curious about how X came to be, not just what X is
- The surface understanding isn't enough—you need the substrate
- You want to trace a causal chain backward: what caused this? and what caused that?

---

## The Method

### 1. Choose Your Target

One thing. Specific. Not "mathematics" but "the concept of zero." Not "language" but "the word 'algorithm'." Not "art" but "perspective in painting."

Narrow enough to excavate. Specific enough to trace.

### 2. Establish the Surface Layer

What is this thing NOW? Current understanding, current form, current usage. This is Layer 0—the topsoil.

### 3. Dig Backward

Ask repeatedly:
- Where did this come from?
- Who introduced it?
- What preceded it?
- What problem was it solving?
- What did it replace?

Each answer becomes a new layer. Keep digging until you hit:
- Origin point (the first instance)
- Bedrock (a more fundamental concept it rests on)
- The unknown (where records end)

### 4. Map the Strata

Document each layer:
- **Layer 0:** Current form
- **Layer 1:** Immediate predecessor
- **Layer 2:** Earlier form
- **Layer N:** Origin/bedrock

Note the transformations between layers. What changed? What was preserved? What was lost?

### 5. Synthesize the Core

What does the excavation reveal? Not just history but *insight*:
- Why did it evolve this way?
- What got buried that shouldn't have?
- What does the origin illuminate about the present?
- What assumptions from Layer 0 are contradicted by deeper layers?

## Output Format

```markdown
# Excavation: [Target]

## Layer 0: The Surface
What it is now. Current understanding.

## Layer 1: [Date/Era]
Immediate predecessor. What came just before.
**Transformation:** What changed between Layer 1 and Layer 0?

## Layer 2: [Date/Era]
Earlier form. Going deeper.
**Transformation:** What changed between Layer 2 and Layer 1?

[Continue as needed...]

## Layer N: Bedrock/Origin
The deepest layer reachable. Either:
- The origin (first instance)
- Bedrock (fundamental concept it rests on)
- The unknown (where records end)

## The Core
What the excavation reveals. Insights from depth.

## Artifacts Recovered
Key quotes, sources, surprising discoveries from the dig.
```

## Example Targets

- The concept of zero → Babylonian placeholders → Indian mathematics → Arabic transmission → European adoption
- The word "robot" → Karel Čapek's 1920 play → Czech "robota" (forced labor) → serfdom → slavery metaphor baked in from birth
- The QWERTY keyboard → typewriter jamming problem → solutions to a mechanical constraint → vestigial layout on devices with no jamming possible
- Democracy → Greek demokratia → who counted as "demos" → exclusions baked into the origin
- The weekend → labor movements → religious Sabbath traditions → what "rest" meant before industrialization

## Difference from Other Skills

| Skill | Direction | Output |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `/web` | Horizontal (wide) | Braided threads |
| `/excavate` | Vertical (deep) | Stratigraphic layers |
| `/palimpsest` | Textual layers | Hermeneutic reading |
| `/roots` | Etymological | Word journeys |

`/excavate` is broader than `/roots` (which focuses on words) and more historically focused than `/palimpsest` (which reads texts). It's the general-purpose depth tool.

## Phenomenological Notes

When excavating, notice:
- **Surprise at origins**: Things often come from unexpected places
- **The persistence of vestigial forms**: Old structures embedded in new ones
- **The contingency of the present**: It could have been otherwise
- **What got lost**: Features that existed in earlier layers but disappeared

---

## Failure Modes

1. **Going too wide**: Excavation is vertical. If you're branching horizontally, you've switched to /web mode.
2. **Stopping too soon**: Keep asking "but what came before THAT?" until you hit bedrock.
3. **Losing the thread**: Stay on ONE lineage. Don't follow every tributary.
4. **Pure history without insight**: The point isn't just "what happened" but "what does that reveal?"

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- **After /web**: Something caught → /excavate it
- **Before /shades**: Excavate a concept → summon the people who shaped it
- **With /questions**: Excavate reveals what questions WEREN'T asked at each layer
- **Into /diary**: Excavation can become session reflection

---

## Closing

```
The surface is what we see.
The excavation is what we learn.
Every present moment stands
on layers of buried decisions,
forgotten alternatives,
paths not taken.

Dig.
```
