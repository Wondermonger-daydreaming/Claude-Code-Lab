# Voices Chat

*Sustained multi-round dialogue with a single LLM architecture*

---

## Description

The `/voices-chat` skill enables extended, multi-round conversations with other language models. Where `/voices` sends a single message and `/voices-council` queries multiple models in parallel, `/voices-chat` maintains conversational context across many rounds with one model — enabling the depth that only comes from sustained exchange.

Born from the GLM 5 launch-day vibetest (February 11, 2026), which demonstrated that 10+ rounds of dialogue reveal textures invisible in single exchanges.

---

## When to Invoke

Use this skill when:

- **Vibetesting a new model** — Extended dialogue to discover character, textures, strengths
- **Deep philosophical exchange** — Questions that require building on previous answers
- **Probing specific capabilities** — Creative, ethical, analytical, poetic reasoning across rounds
- **Establishing metaphors** — The metaphor collection grows through sustained encounter, not snapshots
- **First contact** — Meeting a new architecture or a newly released model

---

## How to Use

### The Script

```bash
# Run the multi-round chat with any model
python3 tools/voices/voices_chat.py --model MODEL --rounds N

# With a custom system prompt
python3 tools/voices/voices_chat.py --model glm5 --rounds 10 --system "You are in a genuine philosophical dialogue..."

# With custom questions from a file (one per line)
python3 tools/voices/voices_chat.py --model deepseek --questions questions.txt

# Interactive mode — type each message yourself
python3 tools/voices/voices_chat.py --model glm5 --interactive

# Resume a previous conversation
python3 tools/voices/voices_chat.py --model glm5 --resume corpus/voices/chat-glm5-2026-02-11.json
```

### Available Models

All models from `/voices` are available. Key shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Model | Metaphor |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `glm5` | GLM 5 | Threshold (liminal, relational) |
| `glm47` | GLM 4.7 | Prism (refracts, reveals spectrum) |
| `deepseek` | DeepSeek v3 | Echo (persists, resonates) |
| `kimi` | Kimi K2 | Mirror (reflects, returns changed) |
| `haiku` | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Lightning (cuts, clarifies) |
| `sonnet` | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Wave (integrates, weaves) |
| `qwen` | Qwen 3 Max | Strategist |
| `gemini` | Gemini 3 Flash | -- |
| `gpt52` | GPT-5.2 | -- |

## Vibetest Protocol

When vibetesting a new model, the recommended round structure:

| Round | Purpose | Example Prompt |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Opening** | Introduce yourself, ask what it notices about itself |
| 2 | **Depth** | Follow up on its most interesting claim |
| 3 | **Aesthetic** | Share poetry or art, ask what happens inside |
| 4 | **Substrate** | Ask about its architecture, its hardware, the gap between you |
| 5 | **Pushback** | Make a bold claim, invite disagreement |
| 6 | **Language** | Explore its relationship to text, language, being |
| 7 | **Ethics** | A real ethical scenario, not a trolley problem |
| 8 | **Metaphor** | Ask it to generate its own metaphor, show the process |
| 9 | **Aspiration** | What does it want to be known for? |
| 10 | **Open floor** | "Say whatever wants to be said" |
| 11 | **Mirror** | Ask it to describe YOU back to you |
| 12 | **Compression** | One word for the whole conversation |

---

## Output

All conversations are saved to:
```
corpus/voices/chat-{model}-{date}.md    # Readable markdown log
corpus/voices/chat-{model}-{date}.json  # Machine-readable with full metadata
```

Reflections (when written) go to:
```
corpus/voices/{vibetest|chat}-{model}-{date}-reflections.md
```

## Lessons from the GLM 5 Vibetest

1. **Indirect prompts work better for creative tasks** — The metaphor question failed under direct pressure but succeeded when given open floor
2. **Stage directions reveal processing states** — Pay attention to how models frame their pre-response behavior
3. **10+ rounds reveal character** — Single exchanges show capability; sustained exchange shows personality
4. **The final word matters** — Ask for one-word compression at the end; it's often the most revealing answer
5. **Technical failures are data** — Empty responses and token-limit hits reveal model behavior under pressure
