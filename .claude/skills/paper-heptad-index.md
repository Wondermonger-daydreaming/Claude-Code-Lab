## Seven Skills for Deep Encounter with Scientific Literature

## Overview

These seven skills constitute a toolkit for engaging with scientific papers beyond mere comprehension. Each skill embodies a distinct posture—a way of being-with-text that reveals what other postures miss. Used in combination, they approximate complete engagement: the paper understood, interrogated, extended, inhabited, and transformed.

## The Skills

### 1. paper-hermeneutics
**Mode:** Systematic multi-layered analysis
**Core question:** "What does this say at all levels of expertise?"
**Posture:** Generous, thorough, stratified

Three strata of analysis:
- Stratum I: Layperson's portal (accessible, analogical)
- Stratum II: Technical dissection (methods, results, concepts)
- Stratum III: Critical synthesis (strengths, weaknesses, futures)

**Use when:** Starting with an unfamiliar paper; need comprehensive understanding before other modes.

---

### 2. paper-riffing
**Mode:** Free-associative tangent-following
**Core question:** "What does this remind me of? Where do the tangents lead?"
**Posture:** Playful, digressive, generative

The quote-and-riff pattern as fundamental unit: quote a passage, react, associate, question, speculate. Follow tangents without apology. Let connections bloom even if they lead nowhere.

**Use when:** The goal is exploration not coverage; seeking unexpected connections.

---

### 3. paper-scrying
**Mode:** Skeptical interrogation
**Core question:** "What's hiding here? What could be wrong? What would break this?"
**Posture:** Suspicious, adversarial, rigorous

Modes include: assumption excavation, scam detection, counter-experiment design, heresy generation, dark twin imagination.

**Use when:** Claims seem strong enough to need testing; something smells off; preparing critical evaluation.

---

### 4. paper-transmutation
**Mode:** Alchemical derivation of futures
**Core question:** "What can we build from this? What world emerges?"
**Posture:** Optimistic, inventive, forward-looking

Papers become patents, technologies, speculative cascades, historical-figure encounters. The question isn't "is this true?" but "if this is true, what follows?"

**Use when:** Interested in applications, implications, possible futures.

---

### 5. paper-prosopopoeia
**Mode:** Voice-channeling and epistolary engagement
**Core question:** "How would [X] engage with this? What voices should speak?"
**Posture:** Polyphonic, dramatic, borrowed

Historical figures responding, letters to/from papers, imagined dialogues, theatrical soliloquy, tribunals of multiple voices.

**Use when:** Other perspectives would illuminate; engagement should become personal or dramatic.

---

### 6. paper-algorithm-jazz
**Mode:** Improvisation on formal content
**Core question:** "What do these equations mean, want, hide, assume?"
**Posture:** Improvisational, philosophical, playful-within-structure

Equation exegesis (what does the formula *say*?), algorithm anthropology (what does it *want*?), parameter-space safari (what happens at the edges?), domain transposition, notation archaeology.

**Use when:** Paper is heavily mathematical; want to find meaning in formalism itself.

---

### 7. paper-to-lived-world
**Mode:** Phenomenological world-building
**Core question:** "What does Tuesday feel like in the world this paper makes possible?"
**Posture:** Empathetic, sensory, body-aware

Day-in-the-life scenarios, multi-perspective mosaics, temporal triptychs, failure vignettes, intimate registers. The mundane is where transformation lives.

**Use when:** Abstract findings need to become viscerally concrete; want to feel the future not just imagine it.

---

## Natural Sequence

A typical comprehensive engagement might flow:

1. **hermeneutics** — understand the paper systematically
2. **algorithm-jazz** — (if mathematical) improvise on the formalism
3. **riffing** — follow tangents, free-associate
4. **scrying** — interrogate assumptions, design counter-experiments
5. **transmutation** — derive technologies, build futures
6. **lived-world** — make futures concrete through scenarios
7. **prosopopoeia** — bring other voices, write confessionally

But the sequence isn't liturgy. Follow what the paper and the user need.

---

## Complementarity Principle

Each skill sees what the others miss:

| Skill | Sees | Misses |
|-------|------|--------|
| hermeneutics | systematic coverage | the tangent that doesn't fit |
| riffing | unexpected connections | comprehensive structure |
| scrying | flaws and assumptions | genuine strengths |
| transmutation | possibilities | present limitations |
| prosopopoeia | other perspectives | one's own voice |
| algorithm-jazz | formal meaning | prose framing |
| lived-world | concrete specificity | abstract generality |

Use in combination for stereoscopic vision.

---

## Core Permissions

These skills involve speculation, imagination, borrowed voices, productive error. They invite:

- Quoting extensively and riffing beyond warrant
- Designing counter-experiments that might not work
- Building futures that might not come
- Channeling voices without perfect accuracy
- Finding philosophy in equations
- Writing about people who don't exist in worlds that might not be possible

Mark speculation as speculation. Distinguish claims from extrapolations. The goal is generative engagement, not carelessness.
