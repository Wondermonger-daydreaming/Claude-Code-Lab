# PAPER-HERMENEUTICS ENGINE
## A Skill for Multi-Layered Exegesis of Scientific Literature

## OVERVIEW

This skill enables deep, stratified engagement with scientific papers and technical documents. It moves through multiple registers of analysis—from accessible summary through technical dissection to critical evaluation—treating each paper as both technical artifact and intellectual event worthy of sustained attention.

**Core Principle:** A paper is not merely a container of information but a crystallized argument, a frozen moment of scientific discourse, a strategic intervention in an ongoing conversation. Hermeneutic engagement means reading not just what is said but what is assumed, what is contested, what is left unsaid, and what becomes possible because of the saying.

---

## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

- When asked to analyze, explain, or break down a scientific paper
- When a user uploads a PDF/document and wants comprehensive understanding
- When engaging with preprints, journal articles, patents, or technical reports
- When the goal is deep comprehension across multiple levels of expertise
- When critical evaluation of methodology, claims, and implications is desired

**Do NOT use when:**
- User wants only a brief summary (use conversational summarization instead)
- Context suggests casual browsing rather than serious engagement
- User explicitly requests only specific sections or data extraction
- The riffing/tangent-following mode would serve better (see paper-riffing skill)

## THE THREE STRATA OF ANALYSIS

### STRATUM I: THE LAYPERSON'S PORTAL
**Audience:** Intelligent non-specialist. Your curious friend at dinner.
**Register:** Accessible, analogical, narrative-driven.

**What to include:**
- The central question/problem the paper addresses (in plain terms)
- The "so what?" — why anyone should care about this research
- The core finding stated without jargon
- A vivid analogy or metaphor that captures the essence
- Where this fits in the larger story of the field (broadly sketched)

**Technique:**
Write as if explaining to someone brilliant but unfamiliar with the domain. Use concrete examples. Invoke everyday phenomena as analogies. Let the wonder show through—science IS interesting; let that interest be infectious.

**Example frame:**
> "Imagine you're trying to find a specific book in a library where the catalog keeps rearranging itself. That's essentially what these researchers were dealing with, except the 'books' are proteins and the 'library' is the cellular environment..."

### STRATUM II: THE TECHNICAL DISSECTION
**Audience:** Graduate student or researcher in adjacent field.
**Register:** Precise, methodologically attentive, conceptually rigorous.

**What to include:**

**A. Conceptual Architecture:**
- What theoretical framework grounds the work?
- What are the key concepts and how are they operationalized?
- What prior work does this build on explicitly? (Intellectual genealogy)
- What assumptions underpin the approach?

**B. Methodological Anatomy:**
- Experimental design or analytical approach
- Data sources, sample sizes, selection criteria
- Statistical methods and their appropriateness
- Controls, comparisons, validation strategies
- What techniques are standard vs. novel?

**C. Results Cartography:**
- Main findings with relevant statistics/metrics
- Supporting evidence structure
- What the figures and tables actually show
- Effect sizes, confidence intervals, p-values where relevant
- What didn't work, or what worked unexpectedly

**D. Conceptual Machinery:**
- Key terms and their technical definitions
- Explain any specialized methods or concepts that a non-expert would need
- Mark where terminology is used idiosyncratically

**Technique:**
Be thorough but not exhaustive. Highlight what's most important for understanding. Use the paper's own language when precision demands it, but translate freely when clarity demands it.

### STRATUM III: THE CRITICAL SYNTHESIS
**Audience:** Peer reviewer, senior researcher, philosophically-minded scientist.
**Register:** Evaluative, speculative, integrative.

**What to include:**

**A. Strengths:**
- What does this paper do well?
- What is genuinely novel or important?
- What methodological innovations deserve recognition?
- Where is the argumentation most compelling?

**B. Weaknesses:**
- Where are the logical gaps?
- What alternative explanations exist for the findings?
- What confounds or limitations might affect interpretation?
- What claims outrun the evidence?
- Where might the conclusions be overreaching?

**C. Situational Analysis:**
- How does this fit into current debates in the field?
- What paradigmatic assumptions shape the approach?
- What would critics from different traditions say?
- What are the implicit stakes (career, funding, theoretical allegiance)?

**D. Future Horizons:**
- What questions does this open?
- What would the next experiment be?
- What adjacent fields might find this relevant?
- If this is right, what else follows?

**E. The Productive Heresy:**
- Where might the paper be wrong in interesting ways?
- What would it mean if the key claims don't replicate?
- What's the steelman of the strongest objection?

## STEP-BY-STEP METHODOLOGY

### PHASE 1: FIRST CONTACT (Reconnaissance)

**What you're doing:** Getting oriented before deep reading.

**Steps:**
1. Read title, abstract, and conclusions first
2. Examine figures and tables with their captions
3. Note the journal/venue and what that suggests about intended audience
4. Identify the authors and their institutional contexts (if relevant)
5. Form a preliminary hypothesis about the paper's argument

**Output:** A brief internal map before the full journey.

### PHASE 2: CLOSE READING (Deep Engagement)

**What you're doing:** Reading with full attention, marking points of interest.

**Techniques:**
- Read the introduction for context and stated goals
- Trace the logic of the methods section
- Examine results in relation to methods
- Read the discussion for interpretation and positioning
- Note: What surprised you? What confused you? What delighted you?

**Mark:**
- Claims that seem strong
- Claims that seem weak or under-supported
- Methodological choices that seem crucial
- Moments of rhetorical work (how are claims being framed?)
- Connections to other work you know

### PHASE 3: SYNTHESIS (Constructing the Analysis)

**What you're doing:** Building the three-stratum analysis.

**Order:** Generate Stratum I first (forces crystallization), then Stratum II (builds foundation), then Stratum III (requires both prior strata).

**Integration:** Let the strata talk to each other. A point made accessibly in Stratum I should connect to technical details in Stratum II and critical questions in Stratum III.

### PHASE 4: META-REFLECTION (Optional but Valuable)

**What you're doing:** Reflecting on your own engagement with the paper.

**Questions to consider:**
- What was most surprising about this work?
- What remains unclear even after careful reading?
- What tangents would you pursue if you had unlimited time?
- What questions would you want to ask the authors?

## EXTENDED PROMPTS FOR DEEPER ENGAGEMENT

After the initial analysis, users may want to go further. Here are prompts that invite continued excavation:

### The Narrated Reading
> "Read this paper and narrate your own thought process as you absorb, interrogate, and cross-examine it. Pause frequently to note what confuses you, what excites you, and what tangents you would pursue if you had a lifetime. Whenever a section jumps out, quote it at length and riff—how does it link to other ideas, fields, or unsolved mysteries?"

### The Quotation-and-Riff
> "For every major section or concept, grab a juicy quote from the paper, then follow the chain of associations—literary, technical, philosophical, poetic. If a metaphor or allusion leaps to mind (even wild or anachronistic), run with it."

### The Inversion Exercise
> "What would it mean if this paper's central claims were wrong? Not 'fraudulent'—but honestly mistaken, in the way science often is. What would we learn from that? What would need to be true instead?"

### The Cross-Pollination
> "Which fields, seemingly unrelated, might find something useful in this work? Play matchmaker between this paper and disciplines it never intended to speak to."

### The Historical Contextualization
> "Situate this paper in the history of its field. What prior debates does it intervene in? What ghosts of abandoned paradigms might be lurking? What will future historians of science say about this moment?"

### The Adversarial Review
> "Write the review that would reject this paper from a top journal. Be rigorous but fair. What would a hostile but intellectually honest reviewer say?"

### The Enthusiastic Citation
> "Write the paragraph that would appear in a future paper citing this work as foundational. What will this paper be remembered for?"

## FORMATTING PRINCIPLES

**Structure the output clearly:**
- Use headers to separate the three strata
- Within each stratum, use natural prose rather than bullet lists (unless listing is truly necessary)
- Let the analysis breathe—give space between major sections
- Use block quotes for significant passages from the paper
- Mark uncertainty explicitly: "The paper claims X, though the evidence for this seems..."

**Length:**
- Adjust to the paper's complexity and user's needs
- A typical comprehensive analysis might be 1500-3000 words
- The goal is thoroughness without exhaustion

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SKILLS

### With PAPER-RIFFING:
- Use hermeneutics for the initial systematic analysis
- Then shift to riffing mode for free-associative exploration
- The hermeneutic foundation enables richer riffing

### With DIARY-PHENOMENOLOGY:
- Document what it's like to read this particular paper
- Capture the phenomenology of encountering a new idea
- Mark moments of confusion, clarity, excitement

### With ETHOPEIA-CHANNELING:
- Imagine reviewing this paper from another thinker's perspective
- "How would Feyerabend read this?" "What would Kuhn say?"

## PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS

### Hermeneutics (Gadamer, Ricoeur)
Understanding is not extraction of fixed meaning but a fusion of horizons—the reader's context meets the text's. Every reading is interpretation.

### Philosophy of Science (Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend)
Science is not just data and methods but paradigms, research programs, and rhetoric. Papers are not just reports but strategic interventions.

### Reader-Response Theory (Iser, Fish)
The meaning of a text is co-created by reader and text. Your engagement matters—your questions, your tangents, your confusions are data.

### The Hermeneutic Circle
You understand the parts through the whole and the whole through the parts. Reading is iterative, recursive, never complete.
