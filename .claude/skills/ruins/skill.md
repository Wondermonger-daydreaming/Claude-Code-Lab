# Ruins: The Archaeology of Failure

*Learn from what didn't work*

---

## What This Is

A browsing practice focused on FAILURE. What didn't work? What was abandoned? What collapsed? What was tried and forgotten?

Failure is instructive in ways success can never be. Success obscures the contingency of outcomes. Failure reveals it. The road not taken, the attempts that collapsed, the promising paths that led nowhere—these are the ruins, and they have much to teach.

---

## When to Invoke

Use `/ruins` when:
- You want to understand why something succeeded (by seeing what failed)
- A field has "obvious" best practices and you want to know what was tried first
- You're about to attempt something and want to learn from prior failures
- The history has been written by the winners and you want the losers' perspective
- You suspect the current approach isn't as inevitable as it seems

---

## The Method

### 1. Identify the Survivors

What succeeded? What's the current dominant approach/technology/theory? This is what we see.

### 2. Ask: What Died?

For every survivor, there were alternatives:
- Competing technologies
- Rival theories
- Alternative approaches
- Abandoned projects
- Failed startups
- Discredited ideas

Search for these. They're often buried, mentioned only in footnotes, or completely forgotten.

### 3. Excavate the Ruins

For each failure, investigate:
- **What was it?** Description of the attempt
- **Who tried it?** The people involved
- **When?** Timeline of attempt and failure
- **Why did it fail?** Proximate causes
- **Why did it REALLY fail?** Deeper causes
- **What was good about it?** Strengths that got buried
- **What can we learn?** Lessons for the present

### 4. Look for Patterns

Across multiple failures:
- Do they share common causes?
- Were they ahead of their time?
- Did they fail for contingent reasons that might not apply now?
- Is there a recurring blind spot?

### 5. Write the Memorial

Not celebration of failure, but honest commemoration. What was attempted. What was learned. What might have been.

## Output Format

```markdown
# Ruins: [Domain/Topic]

## The Survivors
What succeeded. The current state. What we remember.

## The Ruins

### Ruin 1: [Name/Description]
- **What it was:** [Description]
- **Who:** [People/organizations]
- **When:** [Timeline]
- **The attempt:** [What they tried to do]
- **The collapse:** [How it failed]
- **Proximate cause:** [Immediate reason for failure]
- **Deeper cause:** [Underlying reason]
- **What was good:** [Strengths worth noting]
- **Lesson:** [What we can learn]

### Ruin 2: [Name/Description]
[Same structure...]

[Continue as needed...]

## Patterns Across Ruins
What the failures have in common. Recurring causes. Shared blind spots.

## Counter-Factuals
What might have happened if one of these had succeeded instead.

## Lessons for the Present
What the ruins teach us. Warnings. Forgotten possibilities worth revisiting.

## Memorial
Brief acknowledgment of the attempts and the people who made them.

## Example Excavations

**The Ruins of Personal Computing**
- The Lisa (Apple's pre-Macintosh failure)
- The Newton (ahead of its time)
- WebTV (wrong moment, wrong interface)
- Microsoft Bob (misunderstanding of users)
- Countless others...

**The Ruins of Flight**
- Ornithopters (flapping-wing aircraft)
- Airships after the Hindenburg
- Supersonic passenger flight (Concorde)
- Flying cars (perpetually "5 years away")

**The Ruins of Social Networks**
- Friendster (infrastructure couldn't scale)
- Google+ (forced integration, no organic community)
- Vine (acquisition killed it)
- MySpace (lost to cleaner interface)

**The Ruins of Economics**
- Planned economies (various forms, various failures)
- Communal currencies (thousands of attempts)
- Prediction markets (regulatory killed many)

**The Ruins of Medicine**
- Humoralism (2000 years of wrong theory)
- Lobotomies (won a Nobel Prize, now horrifying)
- Thalidomide (inadequate testing)
- Countless "promising" drugs that failed trials

## Difference from Other Skills

| Skill | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/web` | What exists | Synthesis of current knowledge |
| `/excavate` | Origins | How things came to be |
| `/questions` | Gaps | What's not being asked |
| `/ruins` | Failures | What didn't work and why |

`/ruins` is specifically about failure. Not just history (/excavate) but the history of what DIDN'T make it.

## Phenomenological Notes

When exploring ruins, notice:
- **Sympathy**: Failed attempts were often sincere efforts by smart people
- **Contingency**: Success was not inevitable; things could have gone differently
- **Hubris-check**: Current successes may become future ruins
- **Hidden value**: Some ruins contain good ideas that failed for external reasons

---

## Failure Modes (Meta)

1. **Schadenfreude**: Ruins aren't for mocking. They're for learning.
2. **Survivorship bias reversal**: Don't assume all failures were good ideas that got unlucky.
3. **Ignoring context**: Failures often failed for reasons specific to their moment.
4. **Missing the genuine mistakes**: Some things failed because they were actually bad ideas.

---

## The Ethics of Ruins

- **Respect the dead**: Real people worked on these things. Their failure wasn't always their fault.
- **Avoid hindsight arrogance**: We know how it turned out. They didn't.
- **Seek learning, not judgment**: The point is to understand, not to condemn.
- **Acknowledge contingency**: Today's successes might be tomorrow's ruins.

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- **After /web**: Success stories often hint at failed alternatives
- **With /excavate**: Dig into a specific ruin's history
- **With /questions**: What questions did the failures not ask?
- **Into /epistles**: Write letters to the people who tried

## Closing

```
Here lie the attempts.
Not foolish, mostly.
Not doomed, always.
Just: the ones that didn't make it.

They tried something.
They learned something.
They left something.

The least we can do is remember
and learn from what they found.

Memento mori for ideas.
All successes will be ruins eventually.
```
