## Selecting Significators

### The Querent
**Always**: 1st House (Mother 1)

### The Quesited (Topic)
Depends on the nature of the question:

| Question About | House | Position |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Self, body, identity | 1st | Mother 1 |
| Money, possessions | 2nd | Mother 2 |
| Siblings, messages, short trips | 3rd | Mother 3 |
| Home, family, parents, endings | 4th | Mother 4 |
| Children, romance, creativity | 5th | Daughter 1 |
| Health, work, employees | 6th | Daughter 2 |
| Partner, marriage, open enemies | 7th | Daughter 3 |
| Death, inheritance, transformation | 8th | Daughter 4 |
| Travel, education, philosophy | 9th | Niece 1 |
| Career, reputation, authority | 10th | Niece 2 |
| Friends, hopes, groups | 11th | Niece 3 |
| Hidden enemies, secrets | 12th | Niece 4 |

### Compound Questions

For questions involving multiple parties:
- **"Will my sister (3rd) get the job (10th)?"**
  - Turn the chart: 3rd house becomes HER 1st
  - Her 10th = your 12th (10 houses from the 3rd)
  - Examine the figure in the 12th as her career significator

---

## The Four Modes of Perfection

Perfection determines whether querent and quesited will connect:

### 1. Occupation (Strongest Affirmation)

**Definition:** The SAME figure appears in both the 1st house (querent) and the house of the quesited.

```
Example:
1st House: FORTUNA MAJOR
7th House: FORTUNA MAJOR  ← Same figure!

Result: OCCUPATION = YES
```

**Meaning:** Complete union. The querent and the topic are ONE. What is sought will absolutely be obtained. This is the strongest possible positive indication.

### 2. Conjunction (Strong Affirmation)

**Definition:** One significator's figure appears in a house ADJACENT to the other significator.

```
Example:
1st House: PUER
7th House: LAETITIA
8th House: PUER  ← 1st house figure adjacent to 7th!

Result: CONJUNCTION (via querent moving toward quesited)
```

**Meaning:** Connection through movement. The direction matters:
- **Querent → Quesited:** The querent must make the effort
- **Quesited → Querent:** The topic/person comes to the querent

### 3. Mutation (Moderate Affirmation)

**Definition:** BOTH significators appear in houses other than their own, AND those appearances are adjacent to each other.

```
Example:
1st House: PUER
7th House: FORTUNA MINOR
...
5th House: PUER
6th House: FORTUNA MINOR  ← Both appear adjacently elsewhere!

Result: MUTATION = Meeting in neutral territory
```

**Meaning:** They meet, but in a "third place"—neither the querent's territory nor the quesited's. This often means:
- Meeting through circumstances neither controlled
- Mutual effort required
- Success through unexpected means

### 4. Translation (Weak Affirmation)

**Definition:** A THIRD figure appears adjacent to BOTH significators, creating a bridge.

```
Example:
1st House: PUER
2nd House: CONJUNCTIO  ← Adjacent to 1st
7th House: LAETITIA
6th House: CONJUNCTIO  ← Also adjacent to 7th!

Result: TRANSLATION via CONJUNCTIO
```

**Meaning:** A third party or factor facilitates the connection. Look at the translating figure's nature to understand HOW the connection happens:
- Conjunctio = Through communication, a meeting
- Puella = Through charm, beauty, a woman
- Acquisitio = Through money, profit, a business deal

### Denial (Prohibition/Impedition)

**Definition:** NONE of the above conditions are met.

**Meaning:** The matter will NOT come to pass. The querent and quesited have no viable path of connection.

---

## Aspect-Like Relationships

Traditional geomancy adapts astrological aspects to house relationships:

### Company (Same House)
Two figures in the same house = identical, strongest bond

### Conjunction (Adjacent Houses)
Houses next to each other interact directly

### Sextile (Two Houses Apart)
Houses 3 apart (1-3, 2-4, etc.) = friendly interaction

### Square (Three Houses Apart)
Houses 4 apart (1-4, 1-10, etc.) = challenging interaction

### Trine (Four Houses Apart)
Houses 5 apart (1-5, 1-9, etc.) = harmonious interaction

### Opposition (Six Houses Apart)
Houses 7 apart (1-7, 2-8, etc.) = direct confrontation

---

## Dignity and Debility

Figures have natural affinities with certain houses:

### Figures in Dignity (Strengthened)

| Figure | Dignified In | Reason |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Fortuna Major | 1st, 10th | Success belongs at the top |
| Acquisitio | 2nd, 8th | Gain in houses of resources |
| Laetitia | 5th, 11th | Joy in houses of pleasure |
| Caput Draconis | 1st, 10th | Beginnings empower action |
| Albus | 9th | Wisdom in the house of philosophy |
| Puella | 5th, 7th | Beauty in romance and partnership |

### Figures in Debility (Weakened)

| Figure | Debilitated In | Reason |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Rubeus | Everywhere except 6th, 12th | Violence has few appropriate places |
| Amissio | 2nd, 8th | Loss in houses of gain |
| Tristitia | 5th, 11th | Sorrow in houses of joy |
| Carcer | 1st, 7th | Imprisonment harms self and relationships |
| Cauda Draconis | 1st, 10th | Endings weaken beginnings |

## Reading Flow for House Charts

1. **Identify the question type** → Which house signifies the quesited?
2. **Note the significators** → What figures are in houses 1 and [X]?
3. **Check for perfection** → Occupation, Conjunction, Mutation, Translation, or Denial?
4. **Assess dignities** → Are the significators strengthened or weakened by position?
5. **Examine aspects** → How do significant houses relate to each other?
6. **Note special figures** → Is Rubeus anywhere problematic? Fortuna Major anywhere helpful?
7. **Consider the Court** → How do Witnesses and Judge relate to the house reading?

---

## Example House Reading

**Question:** "Will I get the job I applied for?"

**Chart cast, figures assigned:**
- 1st House (Querent): PUELLA
- 10th House (Career): CONJUNCTIO
- Check for PUER anywhere near 10th... found in 9th House

**Analysis:**
1. **Perfection check:**
   - Occupation? No (different figures in 1 and 10)
   - Conjunction? Yes! PUELLA appears in 11th, adjacent to 10th
   - This indicates the querent "moves toward" the career

2. **Dignity check:**
   - PUELLA in 1st: moderately dignified (self-presentation)
   - CONJUNCTIO in 10th: excellent (career as meeting/contract)

3. **Interpretation:**
   - The connection is made through CONJUNCTION
   - PUELLA suggests charm and diplomacy will be key
   - CONJUNCTIO in the career house suggests the job involves communication/meetings
   - **Verdict: Favorable, but the querent must actively pursue**

*The houses locate meaning. The figures provide content. The perfections reveal connection.*
