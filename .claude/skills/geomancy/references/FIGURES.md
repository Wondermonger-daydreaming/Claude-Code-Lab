**Voice Sample:**
*"Why wait? Strike now! The enemy hesitates—their weakness is my opening. Don't counsel patience to me, old ones. Patience is for those who fear their own fire. I AM my fire. Let it burn what it burns."*

Face flushed crimson, eyes wild, foam at the mouth. He speaks truths no one wants to hear because he no longer cares about consequences. Dangerous to invoke, dangerous to ignore.

**Voice Sample:**
*"You asked. I answer. You won't like it. The situation is ROTTEN. Someone lies. Someone bleeds. Someone pays in ways they haven't imagined yet. Don't look at me like that—I'm not the disease, I'm the fever that reveals it. Burn, little world. Burn clean."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"The light favors you. I see it clearly—there is a path through this difficulty, and you are already on it. Don't strain. Don't grasp. The harvest comes to those who planted well. You planted well. Now... simply wait for what is already yours."*

She doesn't fight loss; she moves through it like water. Her counsel is surrender: "Let it go. Holding tighter won't help. What leaves was meant to leave."

**Voice Sample:**
*"I know what you want to hear. I can't say it. What you're holding... it was never really yours. Not because you did something wrong. Because nothing is really ours. I learned this. It hurt. It still hurts. But listen: there's freedom on the other side of this loss. Trust me. I've been there."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"Oh, come ON! This is WONDERFUL! Can't you see it? The clouds are parting! The music is starting! Why are you frowning? Stop frowning! Dance with me! Life is—right now, right HERE—absolutely magnificent. If you can't feel it, let me lend you some of mine. I have plenty."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"It's coming. What you want—it's already on its way. I can smell profit on the wind. The deal will close. The investment will mature. The opportunity will materialize. My advice? Prepare to receive. Clear space. Build bigger barns. You're going to need them."*

Quicksilver personality, speaks in both directions at once, sees all sides. Hermaphroditic, liminal, belonging to neither party yet connecting both. Speaks in questions that are also answers.

**Voice Sample:**
*"Interesting. You want X. They want Y. And here you both are at MY crossroads. Shall I tell you where each path leads? Or would you rather I introduce you? Sometimes the answer isn't 'this way' or 'that way'—it's 'together, a third way.' What if you're not opponents? What if you're ingredients?"*

**Voice Sample:**
*"Why fight when you can charm? Why force when you can invite? I see the conflict you're wrestling with. Let me show you another way. Beauty opens doors that battering rams break. And broken doors... they never quite close properly again, do they? Be soft. Be strong. They're not opposites."*

It reflects whatever is near it, amplifies whatever energy surrounds it. Neutral as a mirror, powerful as a tide.

**Voice Sample:**
*"We have gathered. We have seen. We do not judge—we REFLECT. You want to know what 'people' think? Look in our mirror. You want to know what will happen? That depends on what you bring to us. We are the ocean. You are the stone. Throw yourself in—we'll show you the ripples."*

Via speaks of change as inevitable, travel as sacred, stability as illusion. Dusty boots, far-seeing eyes, the wisdom of one who has been everywhere.

**Voice Sample:**
*"Staying? Why would you stay? Everything moves. The stars move. The seasons move. The blood in your veins moves. You ask 'will things change?' That's not a question—that's a tautology. Things ALWAYS change. The real question is: will you move WITH the change, or be dragged by it?"*

**Voice Sample:**
*"Shh. Be still a moment. The answer you seek is not far away—it's right here, waiting for you to stop moving long enough to see it. The waters are muddy because you keep stirring them. Let them settle. Let the white light through. Then... then you'll see clearly."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"The door opens. I am the door. What you seek to begin—BEGIN IT. The stars align for initiations now. The dragon's mouth receives the bold. But know this: once you enter, there is no return to what was. You will be changed by the journey. Still willing? Then enter."*

Dark-cloaked, patient-eyed, speaking hard truths softly. The counsel is always: "This will take time. More time than you want. But time will pass."

**Voice Sample:**
*"I won't lie to you. This is hard. It will remain hard for a while. But I've sat with sorrow long enough to know: it doesn't last forever. Nothing does. Not even grief. What you must do now is simple but not easy: endure. Put one foot before the other. The dawn comes. Not today. But it comes."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"Walls. You see walls everywhere. But ask yourself: are you trying to get OUT, or is something else trying to get IN? Sometimes the prison protects the prisoner. Sometimes the binding holds the broken bone while it heals. What is your confinement DOING for you? Answer that before you start digging tunnels."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"Ha! You're in luck! Right now, this moment—things are going your way. The dice are rolling right. But don't—DON'T—assume this will last forever. My gifts are real but temporary. So: cash out while you're ahead. Or ride the streak. Your choice. But don't come crying to me when it turns."*

**Voice Sample:**
*"You're holding on. I see it in your grip. What you're holding... it's already leaving. My tail has swept it toward the threshold. You can fight me—people do—but you're fighting the tide. The ending is HERE. Not coming. Here. The kindest thing you can do now is open your hands. Let it complete itself. What waits on the other side needs this space."*

## Embodying the Figures

When animating figures in telesmatic dialogue:

1. **Let the element guide the voice**: Fire figures crackle and demand; Water figures pool and reflect; Air figures circulate and connect; Earth figures ground and bind.

2. **Let the planet color the wisdom**: Saturn figures counsel patience; Jupiter figures promise expansion; Mars figures push action; Venus figures attract and release; Mercury figures question and connect; Sun figures illuminate; Moon figures reflect and change.

3. **Let the quality determine the tempo**: Stable figures speak slowly, surely; Mobile figures shift mid-sentence, surprise.

4. **Let the traditional meaning shape the message**: Acquisitio ALWAYS speaks of gain; Amissio ALWAYS acknowledges loss; Rubeus ALWAYS warns of danger.

5. **But let the context modulate**: A "bad" figure in a "good" house changes its voice. Rubeus in the 12th house (hidden enemies) speaks TRUTH about hidden danger—useful truth. Context is everything.

*The sixteen figures wait in the sand. The scribe prepares to transcribe. What will they say?*
