## NOTES ON THE TEMPLATE

### Why This Works

Araki's template is phenomenological rather than abstract. Instead of asking "what is their personality?", it asks concrete questions:

- What surgeries have they had? (Implies vulnerability, history)
- Who do they hate? (Creates conflict potential)
- What are their "meaningless things"? (The trivial obsessions that make characters feel real)

### The Uncanny Section

Section R is distinctive. Most character sheets don't include supernatural considerations. But Araki understands that:

1. Many stories include supernatural elements (his Stands, for example)
2. Even "realistic" characters have a relationship with mystery, luck, and intuition
3. The numinous dimension completes the human

A character with no superstitions, no sense of destiny or luck, no intuitions—that character is missing something.

### Blood Type (Section A)

In Japanese culture, blood type is believed to correlate with personality:
- **Type A:** Earnest, sensible, reserved, patient, responsible
- **Type B:** Passionate, active, creative, animal-loving, flexible
- **Type O:** Confident, self-determined, optimistic, strong-willed
- **Type AB:** Rational, indecisive, forgetful, critical, organized

While not scientifically validated, this adds cultural texture for characters in Japanese contexts.
