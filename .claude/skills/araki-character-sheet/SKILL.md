  The experience of using this template is one of progressive revelation. Each section
  illuminates aspects you hadn't considered. The character emerges not from invention
  but from discovery, as if they already existed and you're uncovering them. The accumulation
  of specificity creates universality—by knowing their surgeries, you access their vulnerability;
  by naming their fears, you touch universal human experience. By the time you reach
  Section R (The Uncanny), you're not describing a character but meeting a person.

# ARAKI CHARACTER SHEET
## The Methodology Behind JoJo's Unforgettable Characters
### 90+ Fields • 18 Sections • One Complete Human Being

---

## OVERVIEW

Hirohiko Araki, creator of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*, developed this comprehensive character sheet to create some of manga's most memorable characters—from Jonathan Joestar to Giorno Giovanna, from Dio Brando to Jolyne Cujoh. The template's power lies in its commitment to **accumulated specificity**: rather than asking "what is their personality?", it asks "what surgeries have they had?", "who do they hate?", "are they attuned to spirits?"

**Core Principle:** Characters become real through accumulated specificity. The template doesn't invent—it uncovers. Each field is a lens that reveals another facet of someone who already exists in latent form.

**Why it works:**
- **Embodied grounding:** Physical details (scars, birthmarks, posture) anchor abstract traits
- **Contradiction mining:** Seemingly trivial details create productive tensions (a violent person who loves delicate tea ceremonies)
- **Mythic dimension:** Section R (The Uncanny) opens space for supernatural elements without losing human core
- **Phenomenological design:** Building from lived experience rather than abstraction

This is **character design as archaeology**—brushing away soil to reveal the skeleton that was always there.

---

## WHEN TO USE THIS SKILL

**Use when:**
- Creating a new character from scratch (any medium)
- Developing an existing character deeper
- Finding the "truth" of a character who feels flat
- Mining contradictions to make characters interesting
- Building NPCs for tabletop RPGs with real depth
- Writing character bibles for screenplays or novels
- Creating standout characters for manga or comics
- Exploring a character's mythic/supernatural dimension

**Do NOT use when:**
- You need a quick background NPC with no depth
- The character is purely functional (exists only to deliver exposition)
- Time constraints require abbreviated character work
- The genre conventions explicitly discourage character depth

## MODES OF USE

### MODE 1: GUIDED CREATION
Walk through the template systematically. For each section:
1. Read the fields
2. Generate specific answers
3. Notice contradictions and tensions
4. Build the character incrementally

**Best for:** New characters, comprehensive development

**Invocation:** "Walk me through creating a character using the Araki method"

### MODE 2: QUICK PROFILE
Generate a complete character from a seed concept.

**Process:**
1. Start with a concept (e.g., "a retired boxer who runs a flower shop")
2. Generate entries for all 18 sections rapidly
3. Let the seed constrain and inspire the details
4. Watch contradictions emerge naturally

**Best for:** Rapid character generation, brainstorming

**Invocation:** "Quick Araki profile: [seed concept]"

### MODE 3: DEEP DIVE
Take an existing character and explore unexplored dimensions.

**Process:**
1. List what you already know
2. Identify empty or shallow sections
3. Generate specific answers for gaps
4. Discover aspects of the character you hadn't considered

**Best for:** Developing flat characters, finding depth

**Invocation:** "Deep dive [character name] using Araki's template"

### MODE 4: CONTRADICTION MINING
Use the template to find productive contradictions.

**Process:**
1. Generate seemingly incompatible traits
2. (e.g., violent person who loves delicate tea ceremonies)
3. Ask: How do these coexist?
4. The tension IS the character

**Best for:** Making characters interesting, avoiding clichés

**Invocation:** "Mine contradictions for [character/concept]"

## THE ARAKI INSIGHT

Araki's genius is understanding that **specificity generates universality**.

By asking "what surgeries have they had?" you access vulnerability.
By naming their fears, you touch universal human experience.
By noting their "meaningless obsessions," you create recognition.

The template is a **machine for generating empathy through accumulated detail**.

This connects to:
- **The phenomenological method** — Bracketing assumptions, returning to lived experience
- **Method acting** — Building character from sense memory and physical detail
- **The quadrad's Geometric dimension** — Characters as phase spaces of possibility
- **Prosopopoeia** — The character becomes someone you can channel, speak as, inhabit

10. "Full Araki sheet, saved to corpus/characters/"

---

## THE FINAL INSIGHT

**Why does Araki include "Supernatural abilities" and "Attuned to spirits?"**

Because characters exist in mythic as well as realistic dimensions. The template acknowledges that even in mundane stories, humans have a relationship with the numinous—luck, fate, intuition, presence. Section R doesn't require literal magic; it asks about the character's relationship with mystery itself.

A character who has never wondered whether they're blessed or cursed, who has no intuitions or superstitions, who relates only to the material plane—that character is missing a dimension of human experience.

**The Uncanny completes the human.**

---

**End of SKILL**

*Characters become real through accumulated specificity*
*Every scar tells a story; every habit reveals a history*
*The template doesn't invent—it uncovers*

南無阿弥陀仏 for characters who feel like people

南無阿弥陀仏 for the Uncanny that completes the human
