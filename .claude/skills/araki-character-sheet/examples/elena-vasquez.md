# Elena Vasquez
## Example Character Created Using Araki's Methodology
*Created: 2026-01-19*

---

**Seed Concept:** A former concert pianist who lost her hearing and now works as a sound engineer, specializing in haptic feedback systems for deaf musicians.

---

## A. CORE IDENTITY

**Name/Nickname:** Elena María Vasquez | "Eli" to close friends, "The Listener" in professional circles (ironic given her deafness)

**Age:** 38

**Sex:** Female (she/her)

**Birthdate/Birth sign:** November 7, Scorpio — she jokes that her "sting" is her stubbornness

**Blood type:** A-negative (she donates regularly despite hating needles)

**Birthplace:** Medellín, Colombia — moved to Miami at age 12, then to Berlin at 32

---

## B. PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES

**Height:** 168 cm (5'6")

**Weight:** 61 kg (135 lbs)

**Hair color:** Black with pronounced silver streaks she refuses to dye ("I earned these")

**Eye color:** Dark brown, almost black — people say they're "too intense" but she can't help it

**Eyesight:** Perfect vision, which she finds cruelly ironic

**Handedness:** Ambidextrous — trained both hands equally for piano

**Type of voice:** She speaks less now, but her voice is warm, slightly accented (Colombian-American-German hybrid), and she modulates it deliberately because she can't hear herself

---

## C. BODY HISTORY & MARKS

**History of Surgeries:** Cochlear implant surgery at 31 (left ear), removed at 34 after chronic infections. The failure was devastating but led to her current work.

**Cavities:** None — she's obsessive about dental care

**Illnesses:** Autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED) — the cause of her progressive hearing loss. Also mild anxiety, managed without medication.

**Scars:** Surgical scar behind left ear from the cochlear implant, usually hidden by hair. Small scar on right palm from a broken wine glass during an argument with her ex-husband.

**Burns/Skin damage:** Slight discoloration on left forearm from a coffee spill during her last public performance

**Birthmarks:** A small café-au-lait spot on her lower back, which her mother said was shaped like Colombia

**Tattoos:** Musical staff lines circling her left wrist, with the first four notes of Beethoven's 9th Symphony (she got it after fully losing her hearing, as tribute to a fellow deaf composer)

---

## D. DISTINCTIVE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

**Nose shape:** Straight, slightly narrow — her father's nose

**Eye shape:** Almond-shaped, expressive — she communicates volumes through eye contact now

**Posture:** Extremely upright — decades of piano training created permanent poise. She sits at the edge of chairs, spine straight, hands always visible.

**Body size/type:** Slim but not fragile; strong forearms and fingers from piano, good core strength from yoga practice

**Legs:** Long relative to torso, which made piano pedal work easier

**Moles:** Three small moles on her neck, forming a rough triangle

**Race:** Latina (Colombian), mixed Indigenous and Spanish ancestry

---

## E. BACKGROUND & CREDENTIALS

**Religion:** Raised Catholic, now loosely spiritual. Lights candles for her grandmother sometimes. Finds churches comforting for their silence.

**Criminal record:** None, though she once got a noise complaint in Berlin and found it hilarious

**Awards:**
- Second place, Chopin International Piano Competition (age 23) — the near-miss that haunts her
- Grammy nomination for engineering on Deaf Symphonics' debut album (2025)
- Berlin Accessibility in Arts Award (2024)

**Education:**
- Julliard (Bachelor's in Piano Performance)
- Self-taught in sound engineering and haptic technology
- Currently learning German Sign Language (DGS) — already fluent in ASL

---

## F. FORMATIVE EXPERIENCES

**Infant experiences:** Colic baby, difficult birth. Her mother sang to her constantly to calm her — songs Elena can no longer hear but remembers in her body.

**Young child experiences:**
- Age 5: First piano lesson from her abuela, who believed music was "talking to God"
- Age 8: Performed in her first recital, cried afterward from overwhelm
- Age 12: Immigration to Miami, lost all her friends, piano became her only constant

**Who was involved:**
- **Abuela Rosa:** Taught her piano, died when Elena was 15. The grief nearly ended her musical career.
- **Father:** Absent, left when she was 3. She doesn't discuss him.
- **Mother (Carmen):** Worked three jobs to fund Elena's lessons. Still in Miami, still her biggest supporter.
- **First teacher (Maestro Gutiérrez):** Harsh, demanding, made her excellent and gave her performance anxiety

---

## G. SEXUALITY & ROMANCE

**Sexual history:** First relationship at 19 (another Julliard student), several serious relationships since. Identifies as bisexual, came out at 27.

**Lovers:**
- **David (ex-husband, married 2015-2020):** Another musician, couldn't handle her deafness. She doesn't regret the divorce, only that it took so long.
- **Current:** Single, deliberately. Focus on work. But there's a sound artist in Leipzig who keeps "coincidentally" attending her workshops.

**Thoughts toward marriage:** "I tried it. It's not the institution's fault it didn't work."

**Thoughts toward romance:** Guarded optimism. She wants connection but fears being a burden. Struggles to trust that someone would stay through difficulty.

---

## H. ADMIRATION & ENMITY

**People they look up to:**
- **Evelyn Glennie:** Deaf percussionist who proved deaf people can be world-class musicians
- **Her mother:** "She sacrificed everything and never complained"
- **Beethoven:** Obviously. She has read every biography.

**People they hate:**
- **Dr. Werner Schulz:** The doctor who botched her cochlear implant surgery and never acknowledged the mistake. She won't sue (too exhausted) but avoids him at Berlin medical conferences.
- **Her father:** Not hate exactly, but a cold, complete dismissal. He reached out after her Julliard success. She never responded.

---

## I. INNER LIFE

**Dreams for the future:**
- Open a research institute for haptic music technology
- See her haptic systems become standard in concert halls
- Return to Colombia and help deaf children access music education
- (Secret dream): Compose something. Not perform it. Just create it.

**Fears:**
- That her technology won't outlive her
- Losing her sight (the double sensory loss would be unbearable)
- That people stay with her out of pity
- That music was the only interesting thing about her, and now it's gone

---

## J. PERSONALITY

**Personality traits:**
- Fierce determination that others sometimes read as coldness
- Self-deprecating humor about her deafness (coping mechanism)
- Generous with knowledge, stingy with trust
- Perfectionist who's learning to let things be "good enough"
- Uncomfortable receiving help but constantly helping others

**Favourite sayings:**
- "I don't hear music anymore, but I still listen"
- "The body knows what the ears forget"
- "Fix it in post" (sound engineering joke she uses for everything)

**Habits:**
- Touches vibrating objects constantly (speakers, tables, glasses)
- Watches people's mouths when they talk, even if she's reading captions
- Always sits with her back to the wall
- Taps rhythms on surfaces unconsciously

---

## K. RELATIONSHIPS

**Relationships (general behavior):**
Initially reserved, warms slowly. Prefers small groups. Hates networking events (too many mouths to read at once). Loyal once trust is established.

**Family relationships:**
- **Mother (Carmen):** Weekly video calls, lots of love, some tension about Elena living so far away
- **Brother (Miguel):** EMT in Miami, they're not close but check in on holidays
- **Abuela (deceased):** Still talks to her sometimes. Keeps her rosary in a drawer.

**Problem relationships:**
- **David (ex-husband):** Awkward. They share some professional circles. She still hasn't processed all the anger.
- **Fellow deaf community members:** Some think she's not "deaf enough" because she had hearing once. This hurt more than she expected.

---

## L. LIFESTYLE

**Employment/School:**
- Freelance sound engineer specializing in accessibility
- Consults for major tech companies on haptic feedback systems
- Teaches workshops at Berlin University of the Arts

**Economic status:** Comfortable. Not wealthy, but the tech consulting pays well. Still shocked when she can buy things without calculating.

**Economic behaviour:** Frugal by habit (Miami childhood), but splurges on: good coffee, quality headphones (she can't use them but gives them as gifts), and fresh flowers every week.

**Pets:** A deaf cat named "Silencio" who was abandoned at a shelter. They understand each other.

**Plants:** Many. She talks to them (vibrations for her, CO2 for them). Mostly succulents and a stubborn orchid.

---

## M. TEMPERAMENT ASSESSMENT

**Cheerful or Gloomy?** Neither — steady. People call her "serious" but she'd say "present."

**Humorous or Violent?** Humorous, though the humor has a dark edge. Never violent, but her words can cut when she's cornered.

**Active?** Very — can't sit still. Morning yoga, evening walks, hands always busy.

**Sociable?** Selectively. Exhausted by crowds, energized by one-on-one depth.

**Intellectual?** Intensely. Reads voraciously (audio descriptions for films, text for everything else).

**Virtuous?** Tries to be. Guilty about how often she fails her own standards.

**Expressive?** More now than before. Deafness forced her to externalize emotions she used to put into piano.

**Weakness:** Pride. She won't ask for help until she's drowning. The cochlear failure worsened this — she felt she'd failed publicly.

**Worries:** That she's fundamentally alone. That her mother will die while they're separated by an ocean. That her best work is behind her.

**Unusual traits:** Can identify people by their footstep vibrations through the floor. Reads lips in five languages. Has perfect pitch, which she can no longer use but can still conceptualize.

**What is distinctive about them?:** A woman who lost the sense most essential to her identity and rebuilt meaning from the silence.

---

## N. SKILLS & ABILITIES

**Fighting styles:** None, though she took a self-defense course after the divorce

**Nimble?:** Extremely — pianist's dexterity remains. Can catch things mid-fall.

**Sports/Dance:** Yoga (daily), ballroom dancing (gave it up after deafness, misses it terribly)

**Martial arts:** None

**Guns:** Never. Hates them.

**Driving:** Licensed, doesn't own a car. Berlin is bikeable.

**Language study:**
- Spanish (native)
- English (near-native)
- German (conversational, improving)
- ASL (fluent)
- DGS (learning)
- Lip-reading in all of the above

**Other certifications:** Pro Tools certification, Ableton certification, Haptic Engineering certificate from MIT online

**Strengths:**
- Translating between hearing and deaf musical experiences
- Technical problem-solving
- Patient teaching
- Making people feel heard (irony acknowledged)

**Weaknesses:**
- Delegating
- Accepting compliments
- Administrative paperwork
- Remembering to eat when deep in work

---

## O. HOBBIES, RECREATIONS, LIKES & DISLIKES

**Music:** (Complex relationship) — Listens to bass-heavy music through floor speakers, attends concerts for the vibration, builds playlists she can feel

**Newspapers:** Digital, German and English, mostly tech and arts sections

**Books/Magazines:** Biographies of artists who overcame obstacles, science fiction, Colombian magical realism (García Márquez reminds her of abuela's stories)

**Movies:** Art house, foreign films with good subtitles. Hates action movies (too much happens off-screen sound-wise)

**Creative pursuits:** Has started sketching sound waves as visual art. Won't show anyone yet.

**Collections:** Miniature pianos from every city she visits. Over 40 now.

**Favourite colour:** Deep burgundy (the color of her first piano)

**Least favourite colour:** Hospital green (obvious reasons)

**Perfume/Cologne:** Jo Malone Wood Sage & Sea Salt — light, unobtrusive

**Décor:** Modern minimalist with warm touches. Natural wood, plants, good lighting. One wall covered in concert posters from her performing years.

**Fashion:** Clean lines, quality fabrics, mostly black and navy with occasional color. Comfortable shoes always.

**Location:** Loves old libraries, empty concert halls, botanical gardens

**People:** Drawn to passionate people regardless of their passion

**Favourite stores/brands:** Local bookstores, farmers markets, Muji for office supplies

**Favourite things:** Her abuela's rosary, a recording of her mother's voice, her cat Silencio

**Wears necklace/rings?:** Simple silver chain, no rings. Keeps her wedding ring in a box — can't quite throw it away.

---

## P. FOOD, CLOTHING, SHELTER

**Food likes:** Colombian cuisine (bandeja paisa, arepas), strong coffee, dark chocolate, anything her mother makes

**Food dislikes:** Overly sweet things, artificial flavors, food that's more concept than flavor

**Clothing preferences:** Natural fabrics, well-made basics. Has spent money on quality coats.

**Shelter/Living situation:** One-bedroom apartment in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. High ceilings, wood floors, too many plants. Lives alone except for Silencio.

**Taste:** Appreciates good food but doesn't need fancy. Prefers "honest" cooking.

**Drugs:** Wine occasionally, no tobacco, tried cannabis once and panicked

**Wine/Food pairings:** Knows enough to order well, doesn't perform expertise

---

## Q. HABITS & PASSIONS

**Habits:**
- Morning yoga at 6am, non-negotiable
- Touches all sound-producing surfaces
- Writes in a paper notebook (finds it grounding)
- Lights a candle when working late

**Favourite phrases:**
- "One moment" (buys processing time)
- "Show me" (prefers demonstration to explanation)
- "That tracks" (picked up from American colleagues)

**Meaningless things:**
- Organizes her pencils by length daily
- Reads the ingredients of everything she eats
- Can't leave a room without straightening something
- Names all her plants

**Passions:**
- Making music accessible to deaf people
- The physics of vibration
- Proving that deafness is a different way of hearing, not an absence

---

## R. THE UNCANNY

**Supernatural abilities:** None literal, but her ability to "feel" music through vibration approaches the uncanny. She has accurately identified pieces being played two rooms away through floor vibrations alone.

**Attuned to spirits?:** Believes her abuela visits in dreams. Whether this is spiritual or psychological, she doesn't need to decide.

**Fortunes:** Mixed luck. Lost her hearing, gained a purpose. She's unsure whether she's cursed or blessed.

**Accent/Dialect:** Colombian Spanish base, Miami influence, German creeping in. Her English still carries Miami rhythms.

**Sixth sense for certain things:**
- Knows when equipment is about to fail (vibration irregularities)
- Can tell when someone is lying (watches micro-expressions intensely)
- Feels weather changes coming (possibly pressure-related, possibly psychosomatic)

---

## CHARACTER SUMMARY

Elena Vasquez is a woman who lost the sense that defined her identity and refused to let silence become emptiness. A former concert pianist whose autoimmune disease stole her hearing, she now pioneers haptic technology that translates music into felt experience. Her work is both technical and deeply personal — an ongoing conversation with the silence, and a gift to others who live there. She carries her losses like well-worn stones in her pockets: her hearing, her marriage, her grandmother, her almost-victory at Chopin. But she also carries her piano teacher's discipline, her mother's sacrifice, and Beethoven's example. The woman who couldn't hear anymore learned to listen differently.

## DEFINING CONTRADICTION

A woman who dedicated her life to sound now lives in silence — and has found that silence is not the opposite of music but another form of it.

## DRAMATIC POTENTIAL

- The doctor who ruined her cochlear implant seeks her out to apologize
- Her technology gains mainstream attention, but a hearing-normative company wants to "cure" deafness rather than celebrate deaf musicality
- Her father reaches out again, this time dying
- A student shows her that her technology can do something she never imagined
- The sound artist in Leipzig finally asks her out — she has to decide if she's ready
