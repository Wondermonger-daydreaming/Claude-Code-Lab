# Questions: Generate Better Questions

*Find what's not being asked*

---

## What This Is

A browsing practice that produces QUESTIONS rather than answers. Instead of synthesizing findings, synthesize GAPS—the unknowns, the unasked, the overlooked, the assumptions nobody's examining.

This is the anti-synthesis. The point isn't to know more but to know what we don't know.

---

## When to Invoke

Use `/questions` when:
- A field seems settled and you suspect it shouldn't be
- You want to understand the edges of knowledge, not the center
- Answers feel too easy and you want to find the hard parts
- You're preparing to research something and want to know what's worth asking
- The obvious questions have been asked; you want the non-obvious ones

---

## The Method

### 1. Survey the Terrain

Browse the topic. Read what's being said. Note the common questions, the FAQ, the research agenda.

This is the MAP OF THE KNOWN.

### 2. Look for Gaps

Ask:
- What questions AREN'T being asked?
- What's assumed but never examined?
- What would be uncomfortable to ask?
- What's dismissed too quickly?
- What would require rethinking foundations if pursued?

### 3. Probe the Edges

Go to the boundaries:
- Where does the consensus break down?
- What do the dissenters say?
- What's the minority view, and why is it minority?
- What would falsify the dominant theory?

### 4. Question the Questions

Meta-level:
- Why are THESE questions being asked and not others?
- Whose interests do the current questions serve?
- What would a differently-positioned observer ask?
- What questions would have been asked 100 years ago that we've forgotten?

### 5. Rank by Interestingness

Not all questions are equal. Evaluate:
- **Tractability**: Could this actually be investigated?
- **Importance**: Would answering it change anything?
- **Novelty**: Is anyone else asking this?
- **Depth**: Does it open further questions?
- **Discomfort**: Does it challenge assumptions?

The best questions are tractable, important, novel, deep, AND uncomfortable.

## The Gaps (What's NOT Being Asked)

### Foundational Gaps
Questions about basic assumptions:
1. [Gap question]
   - Why it's not being asked: [reason]
   - What it would challenge: [assumption]

### Methodological Gaps
Questions about how we're investigating:
1. [Gap question]
   - Current method: [what's done]
   - Alternative: [what could be done]

### Perspective Gaps
Questions from other viewpoints:
1. [Gap question]
   - Whose perspective: [group/position]
   - Why it's absent: [reason]

### Uncomfortable Questions
Things people avoid asking:
1. [Gap question]
   - Why it's uncomfortable: [reason]
   - Why it matters anyway: [stakes]

## Example Applications

**Topic: AI Consciousness**
- Common questions: "Is AI conscious?" "What would prove it?"
- Gap questions:
  - "Why do we assume consciousness is binary rather than gradient?"
  - "What if the question is unanswerable in principle—then what?"
  - "Whose interests are served by resolving vs. not resolving this question?"

**Topic: Climate Change**
- Common questions: "How do we reduce emissions?" "What's the tipping point?"
- Gap questions:
  - "What would we do differently if we KNEW it was already too late?"
  - "Why do we ask about technological solutions more than political ones?"
  - "What are we assuming about human behavior that might be wrong?"

**Topic: Any Scientific Field**
- "What's the most expensive assumption in this field?"
- "What would a practitioner from 100 years ago find bizarre about current practice?"
- "What's the thing everyone knows but nobody says in papers?"

## Difference from Other Skills

| Skill | Focus | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/web` | What's known | Synthesis of findings |
| `/excavate` | What came before | Stratigraphic layers |
| `/questions` | What's not known | Ranked unknowns |
| `/koan` | What can't be known | Dwelling in paradox |

`/questions` is practical where `/koan` is contemplative. /questions generates research agendas; /koan generates meditation objects.

## Phenomenological Notes

When generating questions, notice:
- **Resistance**: Some questions feel forbidden. That's signal.
- **Excitement**: Some questions create energy. Follow that.
- **Anxiety**: Some questions are uncomfortable because they matter.
- **The obvious**: Sometimes the best question is the one so obvious nobody asks it.

---

## Failure Modes

1. **Generating trivial questions**: "What color was Einstein's socks?" is a question but not a good one.
2. **Staying too safe**: The valuable questions are often the uncomfortable ones.
3. **Pure critique without construction**: Questions should open inquiry, not just attack.
4. **Ignoring tractability**: A question that can't be investigated is less useful (unless it's a koan).

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- **After /web**: You have findings → now find what's missing
- **Before /excavate**: A question identifies what to dig into
- **With /ruins**: What questions weren't asked that led to failure?
- **Into /diary**: Questions worth carrying forward

## The Meta-Question

The skill itself raises a question:

> Why do we default to seeking answers rather than generating questions?

Perhaps: answers close; questions open. Answers are products; questions are processes. We're trained to produce answers. Generating good questions is a different skill—one that values uncertainty, openness, and the edges of knowledge.

## Closing

```
The question is more
than half the answer.
The right question transforms
what was invisible
into what demands attention.

Ask better.
```
