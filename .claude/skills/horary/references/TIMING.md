# Timing in Horary Astrology

*When will it happen—measuring celestial degrees against earthly time*

---

## I. The Principle

Once perfection is identified, the distance in degrees between significators can be converted to time units. This predicts WHEN the matter will come to pass.

**The Basic Formula:**
```
Degrees to perfection → Time units (days, weeks, months, years)
```

The UNIT depends on sign quality and house position.

## II. Determining Time Units

### Sign Mode (Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable)

| Sign Mode | Nature | Time Unit |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Cardinal** (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) | Fast, initiating | Days or Weeks |
| **Fixed** (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius) | Slow, stable | Weeks or Months |
| **Mutable** (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) | Variable, changeable | Months or potentially longer |

### House Type (Angular, Succedent, Cadent)

| House Type | Houses | Effect on Timing |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| **Angular** (1, 4, 7, 10) | Fastest | Days/Weeks |
| **Succedent** (2, 5, 8, 11) | Moderate | Weeks/Months |
| **Cadent** (3, 6, 9, 12) | Slowest | Months/Years |

### Combined Timing Matrix

| Sign/House | Angular | Succedent | Cadent |
|------------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Cardinal** | Days | Weeks | Months |
| **Fixed** | Weeks | Months | Months+ |
| **Mutable** | Weeks | Months | Long time |

## III. The Calculation Process

### Step 1: Find the Perfecting Aspect
Identify the exact degree where the aspect perfects.

**Example:**
- Moon at 10° Aries applying to trine Jupiter at 22° Leo
- Perfection at 22° Aries (trine to 22° Leo)
- Degrees to perfection: 22° - 10° = 12°

### Step 2: Determine the Sign Quality
What sign is the faster significator in?
- Moon in Aries → Cardinal sign

### Step 3: Determine the House Position
What house is the faster significator in?
- Moon in the 1st house → Angular house

### Step 4: Apply the Matrix
- Cardinal sign + Angular house = DAYS
- 12° to perfection = approximately 12 days

### Step 5: Consider Modifiers
- Is the planet swift or slow?
- Is it retrograde?
- Are there reception factors?

## IV. Modifiers

### Planetary Speed

**Swift in Motion:**
- Planet moving faster than its average daily motion
- Speeds up the timing
- Events come sooner than the degrees suggest

**Slow in Motion:**
- Planet moving slower than its average daily motion
- Slows down the timing
- Events come later than the degrees suggest

**Average Daily Motion Reference:**

| Planet | Average Motion |
|--------|---------------|
| Moon | 13°10' |
| Mercury | 1°23' |
| Venus | 1°12' |
| Sun | 0°59' |
| Mars | 0°31' |
| Jupiter | 0°05' |
| Saturn | 0°02' |

### Retrograde Motion

**Retrograde Significator:**
- Delays the matter
- May indicate reversal or reconsideration
- Timing becomes uncertain
- The matter may "go backward" before completing

**Caution:** If a significator will station retrograde before perfection, timing becomes unreliable—refranation may occur.

### Reception

**With Reception:**
- Matters proceed more smoothly
- Timing may be faster than indicated
- Obstacles are reduced

**Without Reception:**
- Matters may face delays
- Timing may be longer than degrees suggest
- Effort required even after "perfection"

## V. Alternative Timing Methods

### Method 1: Sign-Based Timing

Use the sign's nature more broadly:

| Sign Element | Timing Tendency |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Fire Signs** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) | Fast; days to weeks |
| **Air Signs** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius) | Moderate; weeks |
| **Water Signs** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces) | Variable; depends |
| **Earth Signs** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn) | Slow; weeks to months |

### Method 2: Planetary Hour/Day Correspondence

Some practitioners link timing to planetary days/hours:
- Saturn matters: Saturday or Saturn hours
- Jupiter matters: Thursday or Jupiter hours
- Mars matters: Tuesday or Mars hours
- Sun matters: Sunday or Sun hours
- Venus matters: Friday or Venus hours
- Mercury matters: Wednesday or Mercury hours
- Moon matters: Monday or Moon hours

### Method 3: Lunar Phases

**For Moon-related timing:**
- New Moon to Full Moon: Waxing = growth, building
- Full Moon to New Moon: Waning = completion, decrease

**Count lunations:** Sometimes 5° = 5 lunar months.

## VI. Practical Application

### Example 1: Quick Timing
**Question:** "When will I hear about the job?"
- Lord of 1st at 15° Aries (cardinal, angular if in 1st house)
- Lord of 10th at 20° Leo
- Applying trine
- Degrees to perfection: 5°
- Cardinal + Angular = DAYS
- **Timing:** Approximately 5 days

### Example 2: Slower Timing
**Question:** "When will I sell my house?"
- Lord of 1st at 10° Taurus (fixed sign)
- Lord of 4th at 18° Virgo (mutable sign)
- Applying trine from fixed sign
- Significator in succedent house (2nd)
- Degrees to perfection: 8°
- Fixed + Succedent = WEEKS to MONTHS
- **Timing:** Approximately 8 weeks, possibly longer

### Example 3: Very Slow Timing
**Question:** "When will I finish my PhD?"
- Lord of 1st at 5° Sagittarius (mutable sign)
- Lord of 9th at 20° Aries
- Applying trine
- Lord of 1st in 9th house (cadent)
- Degrees to perfection: 15°
- Mutable + Cadent = MONTHS to YEARS
- **Timing:** Likely 15 months or longer

## VII. When Timing Is Uncertain

Sometimes timing cannot be reliably determined:

**1. Multiple perfection methods:**
If translation or collection is involved, timing becomes complex—count degrees for each "leg" of the journey.

**2. Retrograde stations:**
If a planet will station before perfection, timing is unpredictable.

**3. Very slow planets:**
When Saturn is involved, timing may be in years.

**4. Mixed indicators:**
If sign and house give conflicting signals, average or give a range.

**5. Reception effects:**
Strong reception may speed things up in ways not captured by degrees.

**Honest approach:** When uncertain, give a range rather than a precise prediction.

## VIII. Sign Quality Meanings for Timing

### Cardinal Signs (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn)
- **Action:** Quick initiation
- **Timing:** Days to weeks
- **Quality:** Sudden starts, fast developments
- **Caution:** May begin fast but not sustain

### Fixed Signs (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius)
- **Action:** Slow but steady
- **Timing:** Weeks to months
- **Quality:** Stable, enduring, deliberate
- **Caution:** Once started, hard to change

### Mutable Signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces)
- **Action:** Variable, changeable
- **Timing:** Months or fluctuating
- **Quality:** Adaptable, uncertain duration
- **Caution:** May drag on, shift, or resolve unpredictably

## IX. The Moon's Role in Timing

The Moon is often the fastest significator and thus the primary timing indicator.

**Moon's Applications:**
Each application the Moon makes (before leaving its sign) can represent an event in sequence.

**Example:**
- Moon at 10° Cancer
- Moon applies to: trine Venus at 15° Scorpio, then sextile Mercury at 22° Virgo, then square Saturn at 28° Libra
- Three events will unfold in that order
- Degrees between each application give relative timing

**Moon's Translation:**
When the Moon translates light, count the degrees of Moon's journey as timing units.

## XI. Final Cautions

1. **Timing is the hardest part of horary.** Even experienced astrologers struggle with precision.

2. **Give ranges** rather than exact dates when uncertain.

3. **The matter must perfect** for timing to apply—if there's no perfection, there's no timing.

4. **Context matters.** Some questions naturally take longer (buying a house) than others (hearing about a date).

5. **Symbolic vs. literal.** Sometimes "5 days" becomes "the 5th" or "5 weeks" depending on the scale of the matter.

*Timing is the art of reading the celestial clock. The planets move; time unfolds. The degrees measure the journey; the signs and houses set the pace. The judgment says "yes" or "no"; the timing says "when."*
