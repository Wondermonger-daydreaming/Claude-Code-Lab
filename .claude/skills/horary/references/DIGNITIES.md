# Essential and Accidental Dignities

*The measure of planetary strength—intrinsic and circumstantial*

---

## I. Essential Dignities Overview

Essential dignity measures a planet's **intrinsic strength** based on its zodiacal position. A dignified planet can act effectively according to its nature; a debilitated planet struggles.

**Lilly's Scoring System:**

| Dignity | Points | Metaphor |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Domicile | +5 | Lord in his own castle |
| Exaltation | +4 | Honored guest at the high table |
| Triplicity | +3 | Among friends of the same element |
| Term (Bounds) | +2 | In allocated territory |
| Face (Decan) | +1 | Minimal dignity; saves from peregrine |

| Debility | Points | Metaphor |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Detriment | -5 | In enemy territory |
| Fall | -4 | Dishonored, cast down |
| Peregrine | (weak) | Stranger without resources |

---

## II. Domicile (Rulership) — +5 Points

A planet in the sign it rules is **at home**. Maximum essential strength.

| Sign | Ruler | Detriment (Opposite) |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Aries ♈ | Mars ♂ | Venus ♀ |
| Taurus ♉ | Venus ♀ | Mars ♂ |
| Gemini ♊ | Mercury ☿ | Jupiter ♃ |
| Cancer ♋ | Moon ☽ | Saturn ♄ |
| Leo ♌ | Sun ☉ | Saturn ♄ |
| Virgo ♍ | Mercury ☿ | Jupiter ♃ |
| Libra ♎ | Venus ♀ | Mars ♂ |
| Scorpio ♏ | Mars ♂ | Venus ♀ |
| Sagittarius ♐ | Jupiter ♃ | Mercury ☿ |
| Capricorn ♑ | Saturn ♄ | Moon ☽ |
| Aquarius ♒ | Saturn ♄ | Sun ☉ |
| Pisces ♓ | Jupiter ♃ | Mercury ☿ |

**Note:** Traditional rulerships ONLY. Uranus, Neptune, Pluto are not used as primary rulers in horary.

---

## III. Exaltation — +4 Points

A planet in its sign of **exaltation** is honored and elevated. The second-strongest essential dignity.

| Planet | Exaltation | Degree of Exact Exaltation | Fall (Opposite) |
|--------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Sun ☉ | Aries ♈ | 19° Aries | Libra ♎ |
| Moon ☽ | Taurus ♉ | 3° Taurus | Scorpio ♏ |
| Mercury ☿ | Virgo ♍ | 15° Virgo | Pisces ♓ |
| Venus ♀ | Pisces ♓ | 27° Pisces | Virgo ♍ |
| Mars ♂ | Capricorn ♑ | 28° Capricorn | Cancer ♋ |
| Jupiter ♃ | Cancer ♋ | 15° Cancer | Capricorn ♑ |
| Saturn ♄ | Libra ♎ | 21° Libra | Aries ♈ |

**The degree of exact exaltation** marks where the planet's exaltation is strongest.

---

## IV. Triplicity — +3 Points

The twelve signs group into four **triplicities** by element. Each triplicity has rulers for day charts and night charts.

**Dorothean System (Preferred for Medieval/Traditional):**

| Element | Signs | Day Ruler | Night Ruler | Participating |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Fire** | Aries, Leo, Sagittarius | Sun ☉ | Jupiter ♃ | Saturn ♄ |
| **Earth** | Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn | Venus ♀ | Moon ☽ | Mars ♂ |
| **Air** | Gemini, Libra, Aquarius | Saturn ♄ | Mercury ☿ | Jupiter ♃ |
| **Water** | Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces | Venus ♀ | Mars ♂ | Moon ☽ |

**Ptolemaic System (Alternative):**

| Element | Signs | Day Ruler | Night Ruler |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Fire** | Aries, Leo, Sagittarius | Sun ☉ | Jupiter ♃ |
| **Earth** | Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn | Venus ♀ | Moon ☽ |
| **Air** | Gemini, Libra, Aquarius | Saturn ♄ | Mercury ☿ |
| **Water** | Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces | Mars ♂ | Mars ♂ |

**Application:**
- **Day chart** (Sun above horizon): Use day triplicity ruler
- **Night chart** (Sun below horizon): Use night triplicity ruler
- A planet ruling by triplicity gains +3 dignity

## VI. Face (Decan) — +1 Point

Each sign is divided into three **faces** of 10° each. The Chaldean order assigns rulers.

**The Chaldean Order:** Saturn → Jupiter → Mars → Sun → Venus → Mercury → Moon → (repeat)

Starting from 0° Aries with Mars:

| Sign | 0°–10° | 10°–20° | 20°–30° |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| Aries ♈ | Mars | Sun | Venus |
| Taurus ♉ | Mercury | Moon | Saturn |
| Gemini ♊ | Jupiter | Mars | Sun |
| Cancer ♋ | Venus | Mercury | Moon |
| Leo ♌ | Saturn | Jupiter | Mars |
| Virgo ♍ | Sun | Venus | Mercury |
| Libra ♎ | Moon | Saturn | Jupiter |
| Scorpio ♏ | Mars | Sun | Venus |
| Sagittarius ♐ | Mercury | Moon | Saturn |
| Capricorn ♑ | Jupiter | Mars | Sun |
| Aquarius ♒ | Venus | Mercury | Moon |
| Pisces ♓ | Saturn | Jupiter | Mars |

**Lilly's Note:** Face is the **weakest dignity**. Its primary function is to save a planet from being entirely peregrine.

---

## VII. Peregrine Status

A planet is **peregrine** when it has NO essential dignity whatsoever—not in domicile, exaltation, triplicity, term, OR face.

**Effect:** A peregrine planet is like a stranger in a foreign land with no resources. It cannot act effectively for good or ill. In horary, a peregrine significator often indicates the matter will not prosper—the party lacks the means to achieve their aims.

**Example:** Mars at 15° Gemini
- Not in domicile (Mars rules Aries, Scorpio)
- Not in exaltation (Mars exalted in Capricorn)
- Not in triplicity (Air triplicity ruled by Saturn/Mercury)
- Not in term (12°–17° Gemini = Venus's term)
- Not in face (10°–20° Gemini = Mars's face) → **NOT peregrine!**

Always check all five dignities before declaring peregrine status.

## VIII. Accidental Dignities & Debilities

**Accidental dignities** measure circumstantial strength—HOW the planet can act, regardless of its intrinsic condition.

### Accidental Fortitudes (Lilly's Point Values)

| Factor | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| In 1st or 10th house | +5 | Angular and visible |
| In 7th, 4th, or 11th house | +4 | Angular or strong succedent |
| In 2nd or 5th house | +3 | Succedent |
| In 9th house | +2 | Cadent but dignified |
| In 3rd house | +1 | Cadent |
| Direct motion | +4 | Moving forward |
| Swift in motion | +2 | Faster than average |
| Increasing in light (Moon) | +2 | Waxing toward full |
| Free from combustion and beams | +5 | Not afflicted by Sun |
| Cazimi (within 17' of Sun) | +5 | In the heart of the king |
| Partile conjunction with Jupiter/Venus | +5 | Joined with benefics |
| Partile trine Jupiter/Venus | +4 | Favorable aspect to benefics |
| Partile sextile Jupiter/Venus | +3 | Opportunity from benefics |

| Conjunct Spica (23° Libra) | +5 | Fortunate fixed star |

### Accidental Debilities (Lilly's Point Values)

| Factor | Points | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| In 12th house | -5 | House of hidden enemies, sorrow |
| In 8th or 6th house | -4 | Houses of death and illness |
| Retrograde | -5 | Moving backward |
| Slow in motion | -2 | Slower than average |
| Decreasing in light (Moon) | -2 | Waning toward new |
| Combust (within 8°30' of Sun) | -5 | Burned, invisible |
| Under the beams (within 17° of Sun) | -4 | Weakened by proximity |

## IX. Planetary Speed Reference

**Average Daily Motion:**

| Planet | Average Motion | Swift If | Slow If |
|--------|---------------|----------|---------|
| Moon | 13°10' | > 13°10' | < 13°10' |
| Mercury | 1°23' | > 1°30' | < 1°00' |
| Venus | 1°12' | > 1°15' | < 0°59' |
| Sun | 0°59' | — | — |
| Mars | 0°31' | > 0°40' | < 0°25' |
| Jupiter | 0°05' | > 0°08' | < 0°03' |
| Saturn | 0°02' | > 0°03' | < 0°01' |

---

## X. Oriental and Occidental

**Oriental of the Sun** (rising BEFORE the Sun):
- Saturn, Jupiter, Mars gain strength when oriental
- They are visible in the morning sky, acting openly

**Occidental of the Sun** (setting AFTER the Sun):
- Venus, Mercury, Moon gain strength when occidental
- They are visible in the evening sky

**Application:**
This distinction matters for planetary sect—whether a planet is suited to its position relative to the Sun adds or subtracts effectiveness.

## XI. Putting It Together: Dignity Scoring

**Example: Mars at 18° Capricorn in a night chart, 10th house, direct, swift**

*Essential Dignities:*
- Domicile: No (Mars rules Aries, Scorpio)
- Exaltation: Yes! (Mars exalted in Capricorn) → +4
- Triplicity: No (Earth night = Moon)
- Term: 14°–22° Capricorn = Venus → No
- Face: 10°–20° Capricorn = Mars → +1

Essential Score: +5

*Accidental Dignities:*
- 10th house → +5
- Direct → +4
- Swift → +2

Accidental Score: +11

**Total: +16** — An extremely strong Mars!

## XII. The Meaning of Dignity in Judgment

**Dignified Significator:**
- Can achieve its aims
- Acts according to its best nature
- Has resources and support
- Favorable for the party it represents

**Debilitated Significator:**
- Struggles to act effectively
- May act against its nature or poorly
- Lacks resources and support
- Unfavorable for the party it represents

**Peregrine Significator:**
- Aimless, unable to achieve
- Like a stranger without connections
- The matter lacks substance

**Key Principle:**
A benefic (Jupiter, Venus) dignified does great good.
A benefic debilitated does less good, may even harm through weakness.
A malefic (Saturn, Mars) dignified does its work efficiently—which may be harmful.
A malefic debilitated does its harm chaotically, unpredictably.

*The dignities measure what a planet CAN do. The aspects show what it WILL do. Together they yield judgment.*
