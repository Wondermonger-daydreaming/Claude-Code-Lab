# Impediments to Perfection

*What blocks the way—the paths to "no"*

---

## I. What Impediments Are

**Impediments** prevent perfection—they block, frustrate, or destroy the connection between significators. When an impediment operates, the matter does NOT come to pass as desired.

Impediments are the "no" of horary. They explain WHY the matter fails and WHO or WHAT prevents it.

---

## II. The Major Impediments

### 1. Prohibition

**Definition:** A third planet perfects an aspect with one of the significators BEFORE the significators can perfect with each other.

**Mechanism:**
```
    Lord of 1st ──────────→ Lord of 7th
         ↑                     (would perfect)
         │
    PROHIBITOR (aspects Lord of 1st FIRST)
```

The prohibiting planet "cuts off" the light, blocking the promised connection.

**Example:**
- Lord of 1st at 10° Aries, applying to trine Lord of 7th at 18° Leo
- Perfection would occur at 18° Aries
- Mars at 15° Cancer squares Lord of 1st at 15° Aries
- Mars aspects first → Mars PROHIBITS the perfection

**Interpretation:**
The prohibiting planet represents WHO or WHAT interferes.
- **Mars prohibits:** Conflict, a man, anger, violence, competition
- **Saturn prohibits:** Delay, authority, fear, an elder, time
- **Venus prohibits:** Another lover, pleasure, indulgence, distraction
- **Mercury prohibits:** Information, a document, a message, gossip
- **Jupiter prohibits:** A judge, expansion, overpromising, excess
- **Sun prohibits:** Authority, ego, a father figure, exposure
- **Moon prohibits:** Emotion, a woman, public opinion, changeability

**House Rulership of Prohibitor:**
Check what house the prohibitor rules for more specific meaning:
- Prohibitor rules 12th: Hidden enemies interfere
- Prohibitor rules 10th: The boss or career matters interfere
- Prohibitor rules 3rd: A sibling or communication problem interferes

---

### 2. Frustration

**Definition:** Similar to prohibition—a third planet intervenes before perfection. Frustration emphasizes the DISAPPOINTING quality of the interference.

**Mechanism:**
As with prohibition, but traditionally frustration involves the third planet aspecting the SLOWER significator before the aspect perfects.

**Some authorities use prohibition and frustration interchangeably; others distinguish:**
- Prohibition: Third planet aspects the faster significator first
- Frustration: Third planet aspects the slower significator first

**Practical Effect:** The same—the promised perfection is prevented. The matter is frustrated; hope is disappointed.

**Example:**
- Lord of 1st applying to conjunct Lord of 7th
- Saturn interposes and conjuncts Lord of 7th first
- The hoped-for union is FRUSTRATED by Saturn
- Meaning: Delay, obstruction, or cold reality prevents the meeting

---

### 3. Refranation (Refrenation)

**Definition:** Two planets are applying to aspect, but before the aspect perfects, one of them turns RETROGRADE and the aspect never completes.

**Mechanism:**
```
    Lord of 1st ──────→ Lord of 7th     (applying)

    Then Lord of 1st stations retrograde:

    Lord of 1st ←────── Lord of 7th     (now separating)
```

The planet "backs away" from the perfection.

**Meaning:**
- Change of mind
- Backing out
- Reversal of intention
- The querent (or quesited) withdraws
- Cold feet, reconsideration

**Example:**
- Venus (querent) at 15° Aries, applying to trine Mars (quesited) at 20° Leo
- Venus turns retrograde at 17° Aries
- Venus now moves backward toward 16°, 15°, 14°...
- The trine to 20° Leo is never completed
- **Judgment:** The querent changes their mind; they back out

**Important Caveat:**
Refranation requires checking ephemeris data to see if the planet will actually station retrograde before perfection. Don't assume refranation—verify it.

### 4. Combustion

**Definition:** A significator is within 8°30' of the Sun.

**Effect:** The planet is "burned"—hidden, weakened, unable to act effectively.

**Degrees of Combustion:**

| Proximity to Sun | Condition | Effect |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Within 17' | **Cazimi** | STRENGTHENED (in the heart of the king) |
| 17' – 8°30' | **Combust** | Severely weakened, hidden |
| 8°30' – 17° | **Under the beams** | Weakened, overshadowed |
| Beyond 17° | Free | Normal strength |

**As Impediment:**
When the querent's or quesited's significator is combust:
- The party cannot act effectively
- They are hidden, invisible, overwhelmed
- Their will is subsumed by something greater
- The matter cannot succeed through their agency

**Example:**
- Lord of 7th (the beloved) at 12° Leo
- Sun at 15° Leo
- Lord of 7th is combust (3° from Sun)
- **Judgment:** The beloved is hidden, unavailable, or overwhelmed—unable to respond effectively to the querent

**Exception:** Cazimi is NOT an impediment but a fortification.

---

### 5. Besiegement

**Definition:** A significator is positioned between Mars and Saturn with no intervening benefic.

**Mechanism:**
```
    Mars ────── SIGNIFICATOR ────── Saturn
              (trapped between malefics)
```

**Effect:**
- The planet is "under siege"—surrounded by hostile forces
- Extreme affliction
- Danger on all sides
- No escape route

**Example:**
- Lord of 1st at 10° Taurus
- Mars at 8° Taurus
- Saturn at 14° Taurus
- Lord of 1st is besieged between the malefics
- **Judgment:** The querent is in a terrible position, attacked from all sides

**Variation:** Some authorities consider besiegement by aspect (Mars squares and Saturn opposes) as well as by position.

---

### 6. Fall from Angles

**Definition:** A significator that was angular moves (or is moving) into a cadent house.

**Effect:**
- Loss of power and visibility
- The matter weakens as it progresses
- What seemed strong becomes weak
- Downfall, diminishment

**Example:**
- Lord of 1st in the 10th house (angular, powerful)
- Lord of 1st about to enter the 9th house (cadent)
- **Judgment:** The querent's position is deteriorating; strength is waning

---

### 7. Significator in Detriment or Fall

**Definition:** A significator is in the sign of its detriment or fall.

**Effect:**
- Essential debility—the planet cannot act according to its nature
- Weakness, corruption, inability
- The party represented is compromised

**Not technically an "impediment" to perfection itself, but:**
- Even if aspect perfects, the outcome is poor
- Dignified malefic outperforms debilitated benefic
- A debilitated significator cannot deliver good results

---

### 8. Retrograde Significator (General)

**Definition:** A significator is moving retrograde.

**Effect:**
- Reversal, going backward, reconsidering
- The party may change their mind
- Actions are indirect or delayed
- Return to past conditions

**Nuanced Interpretation:**
Retrograde is NOT always negative:
- For LOST OBJECTS: Retrograde significator often means RETURN
- For ERRANT PERSONS: Retrograde can mean they come back
- For RECONSIDERATION: Retrograde shows revisiting the matter

## III. Identifying Impediments: The Process

### Step 1: Identify the Perfection Path
- What aspect would perfect between significators?
- At what degree would perfection occur?

### Step 2: Check for Interposing Planets
- Does any planet aspect either significator BEFORE perfection?
- If so: PROHIBITION or FRUSTRATION

### Step 3: Check for Station Data
- Will either significator station retrograde before perfection?
- If so: REFRANATION

### Step 4: Check Combustion
- Is either significator within 8°30' of the Sun?
- If so: COMBUSTION weakens or destroys

### Step 5: Check Besiegement
- Is either significator between Mars and Saturn?
- If so: BESIEGEMENT

### Step 6: Check House Movement
- Will either significator fall from an angle into a cadent house?
- If so: FALL FROM ANGLES

## IV. The Prohibitor's Identity

When prohibition occurs, the prohibiting planet tells you WHO or WHAT blocks the matter.

**By Planet Nature:**

| Prohibitor | Nature of Interference |
|------------|----------------------|
| Saturn | Delay, fear, authority, old patterns, time |
| Jupiter | Excess, overconfidence, legal issues, expansion |
| Mars | Conflict, anger, competition, a rival, violence |
| Sun | Authority, ego, exposure, a father/boss |
| Venus | Another love interest, pleasure, laziness |
| Mercury | Information, communication, documents, deception |
| Moon | Emotion, a woman, public matters, changeability |

**By House Rulership:**
The house(s) ruled by the prohibitor identify WHERE the interference comes from:
- Rules 2nd: Money problems interfere
- Rules 6th: Illness or work issues interfere
- Rules 12th: Hidden enemies or self-undoing interferes
- Rules 7th: The other party themselves or a partner interferes

**By House Position:**
Where the prohibitor is located shows the AREA OF LIFE from which interference emerges.

## V. Examples

### Example 1: Prohibition by Mars
**Question:** "Will I get the apartment?"
- Lord of 1st (querent) at 10° Taurus, applying to sextile Lord of 4th (property) at 16° Cancer
- Mars at 14° Aquarius squares Lord of 1st at 14° Taurus—BEFORE sextile perfects
- Mars rules the 7th house (the current tenant/seller)
- **Judgment:** No—the other party (7th house) interferes; possibly another applicant or conflict with the seller

### Example 2: Refranation
**Question:** "Will she accept my proposal?"
- Lord of 1st (Venus) at 12° Gemini, applying to trine Lord of 7th (Mars) at 18° Libra
- Venus stations retrograde at 14° Gemini
- Venus backs away before completing the trine
- **Judgment:** The querent will change their mind; they won't follow through on the proposal

### Example 3: Combustion
**Question:** "Will my business partner agree to the deal?"
- Lord of 7th (partner) at 20° Leo
- Sun at 22° Leo
- Lord of 7th is combust (2° from Sun)
- **Judgment:** The partner is overwhelmed by other matters or hidden from view; they cannot effectively respond. The deal fails.

### Example 4: Besiegement
**Question:** "Will I win the lawsuit?"
- Lord of 1st at 15° Scorpio
- Mars at 12° Scorpio
- Saturn at 19° Scorpio
- Lord of 1st is besieged between malefics
- **Judgment:** The querent is in a terrible position, attacked by opposing forces. Unlikely to win.

## VI. When Multiple Impediments Appear

Multiple impediments COMPOUND the difficulty:

**One impediment:** The matter fails for that specific reason.

**Two impediments:** The matter fails more certainly, for multiple reasons.

**Multiple impediments:** The chart is saying "NO" emphatically.

**BUT:** Consider dignities and receptions. A very strong significator might overcome a single impediment. Reception can mitigate.

---

## VII. Impediments Are Also Information

**Impediments don't just say "no"—they explain WHY.**

The wise astrologer:
1. Notes that perfection is impeded
2. Identifies what/who impedes
3. Explains to the querent what blocks the matter
4. Offers insight into the nature of the obstacle

Sometimes knowing WHY the answer is "no" is as valuable as a "yes" would have been.

---

*The impediments are the guardians of truth. They prevent false hope. They explain obstruction. They say "no" with reason. A clear "no" is a gift—it frees the querent to pursue other paths.*
