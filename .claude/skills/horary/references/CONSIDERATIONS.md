# Considerations Before Judgment

*The strictures—when caution is warranted*

---

## I. What Considerations Are

The **considerations before judgment** (also called "strictures against judgment") are chart conditions that traditional authorities warned astrologers to note before proceeding with delineation.

**Critical Understanding:**

William Lilly **never intended these as automatic disqualifiers**. They are:
- Descriptive of the situation
- Warnings to proceed with care
- Sometimes literally describing why the question was asked
- Occasionally indicating the chart will answer itself

**Lilly's Own Practice:**
Many charts in *Christian Astrology* contain considerations that Lilly then proceeds to judge successfully. The considerations describe; they don't necessarily prohibit.

## II. The Primary Considerations

### 1. Early Degrees Rising (First 3° on Ascendant)

**The Condition:** The ascending degree is between 0° and 3° of a sign.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- The matter is "not yet ripe for judgment"
- It is too early to tell
- The situation has not developed enough

**What It May Describe:**
- The querent is at the very beginning of a situation
- Things are just starting; the question is premature
- Not enough has happened to form a judgment

**How to Proceed:**
- Note the consideration
- Recognize the matter is new/undeveloped
- If other factors are strong, proceed with appropriate caveats
- Sometimes the chart simply says "wait—it's too early to know"

---

### 2. Late Degrees Rising (Last 3° on Ascendant)

**The Condition:** The ascending degree is between 27° and 30° of a sign.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- The matter "has elapsed"
- The querent has been "tampering" with the question
- They may have already made up their mind
- The situation is nearly over

**What It May Describe:**
- The querent has asked this question before
- They're seeking confirmation, not information
- The matter is already decided or nearly concluded
- Events have moved past the point of influence

**How to Proceed:**
- Ask if the querent has already taken action
- Consider whether the matter is genuinely open
- Late degrees often indicate "it's already done"
- The chart may describe conclusion rather than prediction

---

### 3. Saturn in the First House

**The Condition:** Saturn is placed in the first house of the horary chart.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- Affliction to the querent
- The querent is burdened, limited, or suffering
- The matter is subject to delay and obstruction
- Heavy responsibilities weigh on the situation

**What It May Describe:**
- The querent is genuinely depressed or constrained
- Fear or worry is motivating the question
- Real obstacles exist
- The situation requires patience

**How to Proceed:**
- Recognize the heaviness in the situation
- Do not assume automatic failure
- Saturn in 1st describes difficulty, not necessarily denial
- Look at Saturn's dignities and aspects for more information

---

### 4. Saturn in the Seventh House

**The Condition:** Saturn is placed in the seventh house of the horary chart.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- Warning to the ASTROLOGER
- The astrologer may err in judgment
- Something about the situation is hidden or confusing
- The chart may be difficult to read correctly

**Lilly's Words:** "Saturn in the seventh either corrupts the judgement of the Astrologer, or is a Sign the matter propounded will come from one misfortune to another."

**What It May Describe:**
- The "other party" (7th house) is Saturnian—cold, distant, delayed
- The astrologer faces obstacles to clear interpretation
- The querent may not have given full information

**How to Proceed:**
- Proceed with extra caution
- Double-check interpretations
- Consider whether information is being withheld
- The difficulty may be IN the chart, not just warned by it

---

### 5. Saturn Retrograde in the First or Seventh House

**The Condition:** Saturn retrograde occupies 1st or 7th house.

**Additional Warning:**
- Retrograde amplifies Saturn's obstructive quality
- Indicates reversals, reconsiderations, going backward
- Even stronger caution warranted

---

### 6. Moon Void of Course

**The Condition:** The Moon makes no applying major aspect before leaving its current sign.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- "Nothing will come of the matter"
- The question has no outcome
- Things will not develop

**What It May Describe:**
- The matter is already settled—nothing more will happen
- The querent can't affect the outcome
- The answer is "no" because nothing will change
- Stasis, stagnation, nothing happening

**Exceptions:**
- Moon void in Cancer (her domicile): May still act
- Moon void in Taurus (her exaltation): May still act
- Moon void in Sagittarius or Pisces (Jupiter's signs): Mixed tradition
- Some authorities say void Moon means "the matter is protected"—nothing CAN go wrong because nothing will happen

**How to Proceed:**
- Check if exceptions apply
- Consider whether "nothing happening" IS the answer
- A void Moon often means the situation won't change from its current state
- Sometimes the most accurate reading is "nothing will come of it"

### 7. Moon in Via Combusta (15° Libra – 15° Scorpio)

**The Condition:** The Moon is positioned in the "Burned Way" between 15° Libra and 15° Scorpio.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- Zone of affliction and difficulty
- The Moon is weakened, even tormented
- Traditionally considered dangerous

**Historical Background:**
- This zone contains several malefic fixed stars
- Moon has no essential dignity here (detriment in Scorpio)
- Ancient astrologers considered it corrupt

**What It May Describe:**
- Emotional turmoil or confusion
- Unclear thinking, bad judgment
- A difficult emotional passage

**How to Proceed:**
- Note the affliction
- Weight other factors more heavily
- The Moon's condition is genuinely compromised
- Some modern practitioners give this less weight

---

### 8. Seventh House or Its Lord Afflicted

**The Condition:** Malefics in the 7th house, or the lord of the 7th is debilitated or afflicted.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- Warning to the astrologer
- The astrologer may misunderstand
- Error in judgment is likely

**Derived from Pseudo-Ptolemy's Centiloquium:**
"The astrologer plunges himself into many errors, when the cusp of the 7th house and lord thereof are unfortunate or afflicted."

**What It May Describe:**
- Difficulty in the "other party" of the question
- The astrologer is the "other" to the querent—thus affliction affects the reading
- Confusion about the opposing side

---

### 9. Hour Lord Disagreement with Ascendant

**The Condition:** The planetary hour lord doesn't share nature or triplicity with the rising sign.

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- The chart may not be "radical" (rooted)
- The question may not be sincere
- The timing may be off

**Calculating the Hour Lord:**
- Determine the planetary day (Saturday = Saturn, Sunday = Sun, etc.)
- Count planetary hours from sunrise
- The hour lord should match the ascendant by triplicity or nature

**Example of Agreement:**
- Ascendant in Aries (fire sign)
- Hour of the Sun → Sun rules fire triplicity by day → Agreement

**Example of Disagreement:**
- Ascendant in Taurus (earth sign)
- Hour of Mars → Mars has no earth dignity → Disagreement

**How to Proceed:**
- Note the disagreement
- Consider if the question is genuinely pressing
- Disagreement may simply indicate an idle question
- Strong charts can override this consideration

---

### 10. Lord of the Ascendant Combust

**The Condition:** The querent's significator is combust (within 8°30' of the Sun).

**Traditional Interpretation:**
- The querent is hidden, weakened, unable to act
- They lack the power to achieve their aim
- Difficulty in manifesting intention

**What It May Describe:**
- The querent is genuinely in a weak position
- They are overshadowed by someone more powerful
- Their intentions are hidden or unclear even to themselves

---

## III. How to Use Considerations

### Step 1: Note What's Present

Before judgment, scan for:
- Ascendant degree (early or late?)
- Saturn in 1st or 7th?
- Moon void of course?
- Moon in Via Combusta?
- Hour lord agreement?
- Lord of 1st combust?
- 7th house afflicted?

### Step 2: Understand What They Describe

Ask: "What might this consideration be telling me about the situation?"

Often the consideration describes the querent's state:
- Early degrees: "I just started thinking about this"
- Late degrees: "I've been obsessing over this for weeks"
- Saturn in 1st: "I'm depressed and scared"
- Moon void: "There's nothing I can do"

### Step 3: Decide How to Proceed

**If one minor consideration:** Proceed normally with a note of caution.

**If multiple considerations:** Take extra care; the chart may be difficult.

**If the chart is otherwise clear and strong:** Considerations are cautionary, not prohibitive.

**If the chart is confused AND has considerations:** The chart may be saying "I cannot answer this clearly."

### Step 4: Let Considerations Inform, Not Override

The strongest charts can be read despite considerations.
The weakest charts may be genuinely unreadable.
Most charts fall in between—proceed with appropriate caution.

## V. Considerations in Context

**Remember:**
- Lilly himself judged many charts with considerations present
- The considerations exist to make you CAREFUL, not to make you quit
- They often describe rather than prohibit
- Experience teaches when to heed them and when to proceed

**The Wise Approach:**
1. Note all considerations present
2. Consider what they describe about the situation
3. Examine the rest of the chart
4. If testimonies are clear despite considerations, trust the testimonies
5. If testimonies are murky AND considerations are present, be humble about uncertainty

---

*The considerations are the chart's way of saying "pay attention." They are yellow lights, not red ones. Slow down, look carefully, and then proceed—or acknowledge that clarity is not available.*
