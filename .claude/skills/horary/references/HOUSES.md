## III. Derived Houses (Turned Houses)

Any house can become a temporary "first house" for that person/matter, and all other houses count from there.

**The Principle:**
If the 7th house represents your spouse, then:
- 8th house = spouse's 2nd (their money)
- 9th house = spouse's 3rd (their siblings)
- 10th house = spouse's 4th (their home/parent)
- And so on...

**Common Derivations:**

| Original | Turned | Derived Meaning |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 8th | 2nd from 7th | Partner's money |
| 9th | 3rd from 7th | Partner's siblings |
| 5th | 11th from 7th | Partner's friends |
| 5th | 2nd from 4th | Father's money |
| 10th | 4th from 7th | Partner's home |
| 11th | 5th from 7th | Partner's children (step-children) |
| 4th | 10th from 7th | Partner's career |

**Example Application:**
"Will my father leave me an inheritance?"
- 4th house = father
- 8th house = 5th from 4th = father's 5th (his pleasures/gifts)
- BUT 8th house also = death and inheritance directly
- Look at relationship between 1st (you), 4th (father), and 8th (inheritance)

---

## IV. The 5° Rule

**Planets within 5° of a house cusp—even if in the preceding house—are read as belonging to the following house.**

Example: Mars at 28° Virgo with 1° Libra on the 2nd house cusp.
Mars is technically in the 1st house, but within 5° of the 2nd cusp.
Read Mars as a 2nd house matter—it's moving into the realm of money.

This rule is crucial for accurate significator identification.
