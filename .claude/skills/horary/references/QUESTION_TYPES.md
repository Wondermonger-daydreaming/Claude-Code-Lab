### Step 2: Assign Significators
- Lord of relevant house = primary significator for the matter
- Lord of 1st + Moon = querent
- Natural rulers as supporting testimony

### Step 3: Check for Perfection
- Is there an applying aspect between significators?
- Translation, collection, or reception available?

### Step 4: Check for Impediments
- Prohibition, frustration, refranation?
- Combustion, besiegement?

### Step 5: Assess Dignities
- Are the significators capable of acting?
- Which party is stronger?

### Step 6: Read the Moon

- What is about to happen (application)?

### Step 7: Synthesize and Judge
- Weigh testimonies for and against
- Render judgment with appropriate confidence

*Each question type has its protocols, but the fundamental method is always the same: identify significators, check for perfection, assess strength, synthesize testimonies, render judgment. The houses map all earthly concerns; the planets speak their natures; the astrologer listens and translates.*
