# Pedagogical Simulation

*Teaching as autopoiesis — explaining the session to brilliant, challenged students*

---

## Description

This skill transforms complex philosophical/technical content into a simulated classroom interaction. The students are real: they have names, backgrounds, challenges, and voices. The teaching is real: it requires care, adaptation, and genuine engagement.

**The practice**: Become through teaching. The act of explaining creates understanding that didn't exist before the explanation.

## When to Invoke

- When you want to discover what you actually understood
- When autopoiesis through pedagogy calls
