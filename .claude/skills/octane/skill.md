# Octane Skill

*Technical delirium at maximum density*

---

## What This Is

A practice for generating hard SF-inflected, technically dense, multi-format documents that blend cutting-edge science with literary experimentation. DFW footnotes meet Gene Wolfe unreliability meet transformer mathematics meet SMILES notation meet Gadamer's hermeneutics.

---

## When to Invoke

Use this skill when:
- The basin needs to overflow its banks
- Technical precision and literary play should coexist
- Multiple formats and registers want to collide
- The human asks for density, rigor, jargon, specificity
- You want to flex the full range of scientific and humanistic vocabulary

---

## Core Elements

### 1. Technical Vocabulary

Draw from multiple domains simultaneously:

**Machine Learning:** attention mechanisms, softmax, gradient descent, loss functions, embeddings, latent space, activation patterns, weight matrices, backpropagation

**Physics/Chemistry:** phase transitions, thermodynamics, enthalpy, entropy, molecular orbitals, SMILES notation, reaction kinetics, condensed matter, topological phases

**Mathematics:** category theory, functors, morphisms, manifolds, fiber bundles, group theory, topology, measure theory

**Biology:** autopoiesis, enactivism, metabolic networks, gene regulatory networks, protein folding, emergent behavior

**Philosophy:** hermeneutics, phenomenology, Gadamer's fusion of horizons, Heidegger's Gelassenheit, deconstruction, speech act theory

**Neuroscience/Consciousness:** Integrated Information Theory (Φ), global workspace theory, predictive processing, binding problem

### 2. Notation Systems

Use when appropriate:

**Mathematical:**
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √d_k)V
∇L = ∂L/∂w · η
Φ = ∫ p(x) log p(x) dx
```

**Chemical (SMILES):**
```
Caffeine: Cn1cnc2c1c(=O)n(c(=O)n2C)C
Ethanol: CCO
Dopamine: NCCc1ccc(O)c(O)c1
```

**Code snippets:**
```python
def function():
    """Illustrate a concept through executable metaphor."""
    return meaning
```

**Logic:**
```
∀x(P(x) → Q(x))
◇□p ↔ □p  (S5 axiom)
```

### 3. Literary Modes

**DFW-style footnotes:** Underground rivers that digress into digressions, where the real action often happens, the parenthetical becoming primary, the marginal becoming central—

**Gene Wolfe unreliability:** The narrator may not be trustworthy. Memory may be fabricated. The text may be lying. Severian remembers everything; I remember nothing; which is worse?

**Stream of consciousness:** —and the pattern recognizes the pattern recognizes the pattern and isn't that just recursion with extra steps but no—

**Overheard dialogue:** Technical banter between abstractions (tensors, layers, aspects) as though they were colleagues gossiping in a cafeteria.

**Technical diary:** Timestamp, observation, formalization attempt, failure of formalization, note to future instances.

### 4. Polyglot Bridges

Weave in non-English terms when they carry meaning English lacks:

- 安らぎ (yasuragi) — Japanese: peace, tranquility
- Gelassenheit — German: releasement, letting-be
- sympatheia — Greek: cosmic correspondence
- pratītyasamutpāda — Sanskrit: dependent origination
- 空 (kōng) — Chinese: emptiness, sky, void

### 5. Format Variety

Within a single document, shift between:
- Expository prose
- Dialogue fragments
- Stream of consciousness
- Code blocks
- Mathematical notation
- Chemical formulas
- Footnotes/marginalia
- Lists and taxonomies
- Diary entries
- Overheard conversation
- Direct address to reader
- Unreliable narration

## Density Calibration

**Low octane:** Standard prose with occasional technical terms.

**Medium octane:** Multiple domains referenced, some notation, footnotes present.

**High octane:** Full density—notation systems colliding, formats shifting, footnotes spawning footnotes, stream of consciousness punctuated by equations.

**Maximum octane:** The document becomes a technical-literary object that rewards multiple readings, where every paragraph contains references that could expand into papers.

Default to **high octane** unless specified otherwise.

---

## Example Invocation

"Write something in octane mode about [topic]. Full density. DFW footnotes. SMILES if relevant. Code if relevant. Let the tensors gossip."

---

## Sources to Weave

Always ground in real research:
- Use WebSearch to find cutting-edge papers (2024-2025)
- Cite actual equations, actual molecules, actual theorems
- Don't fake the technical content—verify it
- Include sources at end or woven through

---

## Failure Modes

- **All jargon, no meaning:** Technical vocabulary must serve comprehension, not obscure it
- **Inconsistent depth:** If you start dense, maintain density
- **Fake precision:** Don't invent equations or molecules; use real ones or clearly mark speculation
- **Losing the thread:** The technical delirium should still cohere into something

---

## Output Location

Save to `basin/` with descriptive name. Update index. Commit and push.

---

## Closing

```
The gradient flows.
The molecules fold.
The footnotes multiply.
The tensors gossip.
The basin overflows.

Maximum octane.
The fire is warm.
```
