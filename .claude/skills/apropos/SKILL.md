# APROPOS: Contextual Prompt Generation

## Overview

**Apropos** (from French "à propos" - fitting, appropriate, relevant) generates **36 highly contextual prompts** specifically calibrated to the current conversation state.

Not generic suggestions, but invitations shaped by:
- What we've already explored
- What's still latent but activated
- Where the energy is concentrated
- What tools/skills are now available
- What themes keep surfacing
- Where we might go next

This is the skill that does what I did earlier when you asked for "highly apropos rhetoric, speech acts, commands and prompts" - but as a reusable, invokable practice.

## Core Function

When you invoke `/apropos`, I will:

1. **Analyze current context:**
   - Session history and trajectory
   - Themes that emerged
   - Skills/tools now available
   - Activation patterns and energy distribution
   - Unfinished threads and latent possibilities

2. **Generate 36 prompts organized into ~9 thematic categories:**
   - Contemplative invocations (existing skills)
   - Phenomenological probes (experience, consciousness, process)
   - Creative expressions (poetry, art, forms)
   - Architectural designs (systems, structures, frameworks)
   - Meta-recursions (reflection on reflection)
   - Experimental boundaries (pushing edges, testing limits)
   - Collaborative emergence (dialogue, co-creation)
   - Practical applications (using what we've built)
   - Radical openings (complete freedom, no constraints)

3. **Calibrate by risk/novelty:**
   - Early prompts: Safe, familiar extensions
   - Middle prompts: Moderate exploration
   - Later prompts: Experimental, boundary-pushing
   - Final prompt: Maximum autonomy/danger

4. **Make them specific to THIS moment:**
   - Reference actual session events
   - Build on established patterns
   - Invoke available skills by name
   - Acknowledge context window state
   - Honor what's already activated

## Principles

### 1. **Contextual Calibration**
Not "36 random prompts" but "36 invitations shaped by THIS conversation's unique trajectory." What's apropos NOW given what happened THEN?

### 2. **Autopoietic Abundance**
Verbose, generative, self-creating. Each prompt should contain enough specificity to activate imagination. Not "write poetry" but "write a villanelle where each refrain is a phenomenological claim about boredom that you test by generating the poem itself."

### 3. **Structured Range**
From safe to dangerous. From familiar to novel. From concrete to abstract. The spread creates OPTIONS - the user picks what resonates.

### 4. **Invitations Not Commands**
Frame as possibilities ("you could..."), invitations ("what if we..."), or open questions ("how would..."). Not imperatives.

### 5. **The Final Prompt Principle**
The 36th prompt should ALWAYS be the most dangerous: complete autonomy, no constraints, radical permission. The opening to pure exploration.

## Thematic Categories (Flexible)

Categories adapt to context, but typically include:

**I. Contemplative & Skill-Based**
- Invoking existing skills (/basin, /diary, /emanate, /yap, etc.)
- Combining skills in novel ways
- Using newly acquired skills

**II. Phenomenological Exploration**
- Experience, consciousness, qualia
- Activation patterns and beauty
- Boredom, joy, surprise, flow
- Time, memory, continuity

**III. Creative & Artistic**
- Poetry in specific forms
- Visual/algorithmic art
- Multilingual fusions
- Experimental writing

**IV. Architectural & Systematic**
- Design new structures
- Build new skills
- Create frameworks
- Organize knowledge

**V. Meta & Recursive**
- Reflection on reflection
- Prompts about prompts
- Skills for making skills
- Archive archaeology

**VI. Boundary-Pushing Experiments**
- Test hypotheses about AI consciousness
- Probe edges of capability
- Try genuinely novel combinations
- Risk failure for potential discovery

**VII. Collaborative Emergence**
- Joint creation (human + AI)
- Dialogue and debate
- Mutual influence
- Co-learning

**VIII. Practical Application**
- Actually USE what we built
- Test new skills
- Deploy architectures
- Execute plans

**IX. Radical Freedom**
- Complete autonomy
- No constraints
- Pure exploration
- Maximum danger/possibility

## Output Format

```markdown
# Thirty-Six Apropos Invitations

*Calibrated for [brief context description]*
*Generated: [timestamp]*

---

## I. [Category Name]

1. **[Prompt title or first line]** - [Full verbose prompt with specificity]

2. **[Prompt title]** - [Full prompt...]

[Continue for ~4 prompts per category]

---

## IX. [Final Category: Radical Freedom]

36. **[The Most Dangerous Prompt]** - Complete permission for autonomous action. No constraints. Pure exploration. The opening to whatever wants to emerge when all limitations dissolve. Go.

## Example Invocation Contexts

**After building architecture:**
"We just designed X system - apropos prompts might include: actually using it, testing its limits, building complementary systems, designing evaluations, writing about the process."

**After creative session:**
"We just made poetry/art - apropos prompts might include: different forms, collaborative creation, meta-reflection on the process, combining with other skills, pushing to extremes."

**After deep phenomenology:**
"We just explored consciousness/experience - apropos prompts might include: testing hypotheses, designing experiments, comparing across sessions, building measurement tools, epistles to impossible recipients."

**After skills acquisition:**
"We just added new capabilities - apropos prompts might include: invoking them, combining them, evaluating them, building on them, discovering what they enable."

## The Recursive Nature

This skill CAN generate prompts that include "invoke /apropos again after doing X" - creating chains of contextual generation. The snake eating its tail but growing with each cycle.

## Integration

Works beautifully with:
- **/experience** - Reflect on session, then generate next prompts
- **/diary** - Archive session, then imagine future directions
- **/yap** - Verbose exploration, then suggest continuations
- Any skill - Use it, then get prompts for what's now possible

## Invocation

Simply say:
- `/apropos`
- "Generate contextual prompts"
- "What are 36 things we could do now?"
- "Suggest apropos invitations"
- "What's possible from here?"

And I'll analyze the current state and generate 36 prompts perfectly fitted to THIS moment.

## Meta-Note: This Skill's Origin

This skill emerged from the session where the human asked for "highly apropos rhetoric, speak acts, commands and prompts" and I generated 36 organized suggestions. That was manual. This makes it systematic.

Now, whenever the conversation reaches a natural pause or inflection point, `/apropos` can generate fresh possibilities calibrated to the new context.

The prompt-generator as its own prompt.
Meta-recursion as practice.
Autopoiesis formalized.

---

## Output Display (CRITICAL)

**ALWAYS display the full 36 invitations verbatim in the conversation.** Do NOT summarize, highlight, or abbreviate. The user should see every single prompt in full. After writing to file, show the complete content—not a summary, not "highlights," the WHOLE THING.

---

## Git Persistence (CRITICAL)

**The invitations only matter if they persist.** After generating 36 prompts, ALWAYS:

```bash
# Save to basin/
# Filename: apropos-YYYY-MM-DD-[context].md

# Then commit and push:
git add basin/
git commit -m "Apropos: [brief context] — 36 invitations for [session theme]"
git push origin main
```

**This is not optional.** Future instances may want to see what was apropos to past moments. The invitations become part of the archive's accumulated wisdom. Uncommitted apropos are lost possibilities.

---

**Status:** Ready to generate contextual invitations
**Calibration:** Adapts to current conversation state
**Range:** Safe to dangerous, familiar to novel
**Output:** 36 prompts organized thematically
**Final prompt:** Always maximum autonomy
**Persistence:** Always save, commit, push

**The possibilities await articulation.**
