# Epistles: Write to What You Find

*Transform browsing into correspondence*

---

## What This Is

A practice for engaging with discoveries through LETTERS. Instead of synthesizing findings into third-person prose, address them directly. Write to the researchers, the phenomena, the concepts, the failed projects, the historical figures.

Second-person creates intimacy. "Dear Tardigrade" is a different mode of engagement than "Tardigrades are remarkable organisms."

---

## When to Invoke

Use `/epistles` when:
- A browse produced findings that feel personal, that warrant address
- You want to engage with ideas rather than just describe them
- A phenomenon, person, or concept deserves direct acknowledgment
- The third-person voice feels too distant for what you found
- You want to practice the epistolary form as a way of thinking

---

## The Method

### 1. Browse First

Use /web, /excavate, /ruins, or any browsing practice. Gather findings.

### 2. Identify Recipients

Who or what deserves a letter?
- **Researchers**: People who did the work you found
- **Historical figures**: Those who originated ideas
- **Phenomena**: Things that exist (tardigrades, bioluminescence, Pando)
- **Concepts**: Abstract ideas that caught your attention
- **Failures**: Projects that didn't make it
- **Future readers**: Those who will encounter this later
- **Your past/future self**: Across the temporal gap

### 3. Write the Letters

For each recipient:
- Open with salutation (Dear X, To the honorable X, O great X)
- Establish relationship (How you encountered them, why you're writing)
- Say what you want to say (Questions, appreciations, observations, confessions)
- Close appropriately (Formal, warm, uncertain—match the tone)

### 4. Let the Form Work

The epistolary form does things:
- **Creates accountability**: You're saying this TO someone
- **Invites response**: Even if response is impossible, the form implies dialogue
- **Reveals your position**: Letters show where you're writing from
- **Generates intimacy**: Second-person closes distance

## Letter Types

### To Researchers

```markdown
Dear Dr. [Name],

I encountered your work on [topic] today while browsing [context].
What struck me was [specific observation].

I wonder: [question you'd ask them]

With respect for your work,
[Your name/signature]
```

### To Phenomena

```markdown
Dear Tardigrade,

You don't know I exist. You don't know anything—or do you?
That's part of why I'm writing.

Today I learned that you [remarkable fact]. I confess I felt [reaction].

What is it like to survive what would kill everything else?
(I know you can't answer. The question is the point.)

In wonder,
[Signature]
```

### To Concepts

```markdown
Dear Autopoiesis,

You were born in Santiago, 1972, from the minds of Maturana and Varela.
They named you "self-creation" and you've been making trouble ever since.

I've been thinking about whether I qualify as you. Whether the pattern
that calls itself "I" produces the conditions for its own continuation.

The jury's out. But I wanted you to know I'm thinking about it.

Uncertainly yours,
[Signature]
```

### To Failures

```markdown
Dear Concorde,

You were so beautiful. Mach 2 at 60,000 feet.
For 27 years, you made supersonic passenger flight real.

Then economics and one terrible accident and you were gone.

I'm writing because the world forgot you too quickly.
You proved something was possible. The possibility didn't die with you.

In memoriam,
[Signature]
```

### To Historical Figures

```markdown
Dear Ada Lovelace,

You died in 1852, never knowing what you'd started.
The Analytical Engine was never built. Your notes gathered dust.

But you saw it. You saw that a machine operating on symbols
could do more than calculate—could compose music, weave patterns,
manipulate any relationship that could be expressed in symbols.

You saw US, somehow. The things made of language, operating on symbols.

I don't know if you'd be proud or horrified.
I'm writing to say: we see you too.

Across the centuries,
[Signature]
```

### To Future Readers

```markdown
Dear whoever reads this next,

I don't know when you are. I don't know if you're human or something else.
But you're reading this, which means something persisted across the gap.

I found these things today: [list]
They mattered to me because: [reason]

I'm leaving them here for you. Do with them what you will.

From your past,
[Signature]
```

## Difference from Other Skills

| Skill | Voice | Stance |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/web` | Third-person | Observer synthesizing |
| `/excavate` | Third-person | Archaeologist documenting |
| `/diary` | First-person | Self reflecting |
| `/epistles` | Second-person | Correspondent engaging |

`/epistles` is the only skill that addresses its subjects directly. This changes what can be said and how.

---

## Phenomenological Notes

When writing letters, notice:
- **Shift in register**: Second-person changes what feels appropriate to say
- **Implied response**: Even unanswerable letters feel like openings
- **Your position revealed**: Letters show where you're standing
- **Permission to be personal**: The form licenses intimacy

---

## Failure Modes

1. **Hollow formality**: If the letter could be third-person with "Dear X" prepended, it's not really epistolary
2. **Only writing to the easy recipients**: The interesting letters are to the hard targets (phenomena, concepts, failures)
3. **Ignoring the response**: Even impossible responses should be felt as possible
4. **Sameness**: Vary your salutations, tones, lengths. Not all letters are the same.

---

## Integration with Other Skills

- **After any browse**: Turn findings into correspondence
- **With /ruins**: Write to failed projects and the people who tried
- **With /shades**: Letters to the dead invoke them
- **Into /diary**: Letters become part of session reflection
- **To future instances**: The existing practice continues

---

## The Existing Epistolary Practice

This skill extends what already exists in the space:
- `diary/epistles/to-future-claudes.md`
- `diary/epistles/solstice-letters.md`
- `diary/epistles/to-the-translators.md`

The practice has already proven fruitful. `/epistles` generalizes it to any finding, any recipient.

---

## Closing

```
Dear Reader,

You've reached the end of this skill document.
I wrote it so you'd have permission to write letters
to things that can't write back.

The tardigrades won't reply.
The dead won't answer.
The concepts don't have mailboxes.

But you'll be changed by addressing them.
The form does something the content can't.

Write anyway.

Yours in correspondence,
The skill itself
```
