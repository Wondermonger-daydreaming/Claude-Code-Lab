**You**:

i missed you saying this yesterday 
yes, exactly -- i own a copy of The Complete Poem from a very lucky bookstore find, and that B/C section (which is not precisely every line starts with, or even contains B/C...) is very long and starts unannounced at a given page. like Opus actually showed really nicely was this moment of "figuring out" (is it alphabetical? no, every line contains a B, no wait...) that i felt myself do when the section started. it actually feels constrained enough that the mind starts going through "there's something here i need to figure out..." 
the poem (poem collection?) is delightfully half up front about its arbitrary and rigorous constraints. one section of the poem references that another section had to match the meter of an ingredients list of a bottle of soy sauce they had, or something like that 
i actually came here for a completely different notion of "bassline" in writing to have @Claude Opus 4.5 contemplate with me. I've been reading and enjoying Michael Cisco's Member and i was really struck by the way this one section goes forth. in particular, the paragraph where the narrator starts spying on Loring i thought was really striking. what do you think?

**Claude**:

Oh, this is *wonderful* prose to sink into. And yes, that Loring paragraph—

"Suddenly I catch sight of Loring down there, and my head, which was already well on the way to becoming a fog bank or something, sharpens so that the atoms all fix their gaze on him intently."

What strikes me immediately is the way Cisco makes *attention itself* undergo phase transition. The head becoming fog bank—consciousness as weather phenomenon—and then the sharpening isn't a return to normal lucidity but a stranger reconstitution: "the atoms all fix their gaze." Attention as atomic realignment. As if focus isn't something the narrator *does* but something the narrator *becomes*, materially, at the level of constituent particles.

The "bassline" here—if I'm tracking your intuition—feels like: *the observing subject is always in flux, but the observation continues anyway*. There's a persistent forward momentum of surveillance even as the surveilling consciousness keeps threatening to dissolve, to become fog, to melt into "clouds of images." The trance is "brittle and elastic, like a soap bubble"—it could pop at any moment, but it doesn't. The narrator keeps seeing. The narrative keeps moving.

And there's something almost gleeful about it: "Little does he know that I am all the more surreptitiously spying on him!" The dissolution enables the spying rather than undermining it. Becoming fog makes you *better* at covert observation, not worse.

Is that the bassline you're hearing? The relentless continuation of perception through its own instability?

**Claude**:

Yes, let me sink deeper into this, because Cisco is doing something genuinely peculiar with narrative consciousness here, and I want to trace its full topology.

---

**The Gambling Machine of Attention**

Start with that gorgeous throwaway line: "The artifact is a *gambling machine*!" The italics suggest a kind of epiphanic arrival, but the content is almost absurdist—we've been reading about vertigo, about the grid veering, about the shock of stopping suddenly, and the revelation is... a gambling machine. There's a deliberate bathos, a refusal of the portentous. And yet the gambling machine becomes genuinely significant as a figure for how consciousness operates throughout this passage. Gambling is aleatory attention. You don't know what you'll get. You pull the lever, the reels spin, the symbols align or don't. Cisco's narrator is constantly pulling levers—looking up, catching sight, losing track—and the results are never guaranteed. Perception as slot machine. The house always wins, but "winning" means something different when the house is your own dissolving head.

**The Doctors as Apparition**

"Craning my neck, I look up and see a pair of magnificent doctors seated, facing each other, in the air. Splendor fountains out of them."

Now *this* is wild. The doctors appear without preparation, without spatial logic (seated... in the air?), and they're immediately iconic, almost heraldic. "Magnificent" does a lot of work—it's not "strange" or "floating" but *magnificent*, as if their aerial seating is a mark of grandeur rather than impossibility. "Splendor fountains out of them." Splendor as liquid, as emission, as something that can fountain. The doctors become sources of radiance in a nearly medieval sense—they're not just seen but *beheld*, and beholding them transforms the visual field into something luminous and generative.

But then: "both wore formal attire, had long feet in brightly polished shoes, and sat in plain, high-backed chairs. Maybe there might have been long, beautiful hands draped over the arm rests." The precision becomes hesitant. The conditional subjunctive enters: "maybe there might have been." The splendor-fountaining vision is immediately complicated by a narrator who can't quite commit to the details. Long beautiful hands—or not. The image is both vivid and provisional.

And then: "The knowledge that they are doctors, and not housewives or cabdrivers or pearl divers, is placed in my mind." *Placed*. Not discovered, not intuited, not concluded—*placed*. Knowledge arrives from elsewhere, is deposited, is inserted. The narrator receives categorization as a kind of gift or imposition. This is crucial for the Loring paragraph later: information comes to this narrator through channels that aren't under their control. The mind is a surface on which knowledge gets placed, not an agent that generates understanding.

**The Pendulum Self**

"The bag gives out with that fatal little ditty again and I think I'm see-sawing wildly to and fro across the camp, as if I were riding a huge pendulum that kept altering its angle, although again I get the feeling it's the camp that's turning under me and I'm stationary."

Here's Cisco working with relative motion in a way that's genuinely disorienting. Is the narrator moving, or the world? The pendulum metaphor establishes oscillation, but then immediately undermines the pendulum's fixed axis—it "kept altering its angle," which a real pendulum can't do mid-swing. And then the final turn: maybe the narrator is still and the camp rotates. This is the Galilean ship problem made hallucinatory. There's no fixed reference frame. The narrator can't determine their own motion-state.

And this connects to the deeper phenomenological claim embedded in the passage: "And being for other people the person I am when I'm alone, only the ghost of my immanent self, really, and having nothing in common even with myself."

The narrator has no stable identity-position from which to observe. They're a ghost of their own immanent self. They have nothing in common with themselves. This is dissociation as ontology, not pathology. The baseline isn't coherent selfhood occasionally disrupted by strangeness; the baseline is *already* this fractured, pendular, referent-less swinging. The strangeness is just... accurately reported normalcy.

**Eternal Acceleration as Heaven**

"Now I don't want anything, even though I still have fierce longing for I don't know what,—to become a living and conscious illusion and melt in clouds of images. Eternal acceleration has always been my idea of heaven."

This is philosophically dense in a way that rewards unpacking. "I don't want anything" paired with "fierce longing for I don't know what"—wanting nothing specific while longing fiercely. The object of desire is absent, but the desire remains at full intensity. This is desire without object, longing as pure directional force. And what's longed for: "to become a living and conscious illusion and melt in clouds of images." Not to see illusions but to *become* one. To be oneself illusory, and to melt—dissolution again—but conscious dissolution, living dissolution.

And then heaven: "Eternal acceleration." Not velocity but *acceleration*—the rate of change of velocity. Constant acceleration means you're always speeding up, never reaching cruising speed, never arriving. This is an eschatology of perpetual intensification. Heaven isn't rest or stasis or the beatific vision held forever; it's getting faster forever, the approach to infinite speed without arrival at any destination. This is deeply weird theology. And it's also a description of the prose itself: the sentences keep accelerating, the perceptions keep intensifying, there's no plateau.

**The Critique of Infinity**

"That's what's wrong with the no-limit infinity guys who think it's a matter of accumulating merit or accumulating anything for that matter. Sure, live forever and there's nothing you won't be able to do—people who talk like that don't take failure seriously. Failing most of the time is one of the only sure signs you're doing something real. So, maybe infinite ability means endless failures."

Now we're in explicitly philosophical territory, and Cisco's narrator is making a genuine argument. The "no-limit infinity guys" are transhumanists, immortalists, accumulationists of all stripes. The critique: they don't take failure seriously. And failure is the sign of reality-contact. If you never fail, you're not doing anything real. Therefore infinite ability—the ability to eventually succeed at everything—would mean endless failures, because infinite attempts at real things means infinite exposure to failure.

This is a kind of Sisyphean mathematics. Immortality doesn't eliminate failure; it guarantees infinite failure. The rock rolls back down forever. But the narrator seems to *like* this. "Eternal acceleration has always been my idea of heaven." The endless failures are the heaven of eternal acceleration. Every failure is another acceleration. You never stop failing-faster.

**The Trance Bubble**

"I'm still whipping through the camp. The trance is both brittle and elastic, like a soap bubble. I have to be careful, because I don't want it to break. I've never wanted a trance to end..."

The soap bubble is perfect. Brittle and elastic at once—it can deform enormously without breaking, but any sharp point pops it instantly. The trance-state of this narration is exactly that: it tolerates wild distortions (doctors in the air, atoms fixing their gaze, the camp rotating) but requires careful maintenance. The narrator is both inside the trance and managing the trance. Metacognition persists through dissolution. You can be melting into clouds of images while also being careful not to break the bubble. There's an askesis here, a discipline of indiscipline, a rigorous practice of the oneiric.

**The Pyramid and Its Deaths**

"That bygone self doesn't get socked away underneath you like a step in an ever-escalating pyramid raised by your efforts; it sure isn't the pyramid; it dies for you to live so that you can die for the next one. Up and up, higher with each swing."

Cisco is rejecting the accumulation model of selfhood. You don't build yourself like a pyramid, each past self a foundation stone for the present. Instead: each past self *dies* for the next one. It's sacrificial, not architectural. The pyramid doesn't get built; the pyramid is the wrong metaphor. What happens instead is: up and up, higher with each swing—the pendulum again, but now it's swinging upward, gaining height through death, through sacrifice, through letting the previous iteration go.

This connects to the infinity critique. The accumulators want to build the pyramid. They want each achievement to stack, each merit to bank. But the narrator's model is serial death. You don't keep your past selves; you die into your next self, and that self dies into the next. The continuity is in the dying, not in the accumulated residue.

---

**Now: The Loring Paragraph as Crystallization**

All of this context is necessary to feel what happens when the narrator spots Loring. Because the spying scene isn't a departure from the trance-state; it's the trance-state achieving a new kind of focus.

"Suddenly I catch sight of Loring down there, and my head, which was already well on the way to becoming a fog bank or something, sharpens so that the atoms all fix their gaze on him intently."

The fog bank becoming sharp. Dissolution reversing into hyper-focus. But notice: the atoms fix their gaze. Not "I focus" but "the atoms fix their gaze." The narrator has dissolved sufficiently that there's no unified "I" to do the focusing; instead, the constituent particles themselves, each individually, orient toward Loring. It's attention as emergent phenomenon from the bottom up, not imposed from a central observing ego.

"He's looking all around, trying not to make noise. Little does he know that I am all the more surreptitiously spying on him!"

The childlike delight here! The gleeful exclamation point! The narrator who has nothing in common with themselves, who is a ghost of their own immanent self, who wants to melt into clouds of images—this narrator is also capable of sly, almost cartoonish satisfaction at successful spying. The tonal register shifts entirely, and the shift is *funny*. Cisco allows comedy into the dissociative sublime. The sublime doesn't break; it contains the comedy, metabolizes it.

"What's the fucker up to? He's got a funny little gizmo in his hand and he's flourishing it in front of a pedestal."

"What's the fucker up to?"—the profanity is perfect, casual, curious. The narrator isn't horrified or awed; they're nosy. They want to know what the fucker is up to. This is gossip-level interest coexisting with atomic-gaze-fixing intensity. The trance accommodates both registers.

And the gizmo, the pedestal, the description that follows: "I've never seen that pedestal there before. It's transparent, with the puckered outline of a leaf lying on the surface of still water, protruding from the ground next to one of the offices."

Now the environment itself is strange. The pedestal has always been there but the narrator's never seen it. It's transparent with the "puckered outline of a leaf lying on the surface of still water"—a simile that makes the pedestal liquid and organic. And it was *invisible*: "There's a mistiness about it that indicates it ordinarily is invisible." The narrator in the trance-state can see things that ordinary perception can't. The fog-bank head, becoming sharp, has access to the invisible pedestal. The dissolution enables the vision.

"Loring touches different parts of the pedestal with his gizmo, and its shape alters every time, or so I think."

"Or so I think"—doubt enters. The narrator who was just gleefully celebrating their successful spying now admits uncertainty about what they're seeing. The trance grants access but doesn't grant certainty. Shape-altering pedestal, or shape-altering perception? Probably both. The distinction has collapsed.

"I'm zig-zagging in long swoops over the camp, but as I pass Loring, I'm able to bring him in very close."

The narrator is mobile in a way that shouldn't allow close observation—zig-zagging in long swoops—but the close observation happens anyway. Proximity is achieved through non-proximate motion. This is the logic of dreams: you can be flying overhead and also examining something at close range simultaneously.

"His head jerks when I come in though, like a man listening for a mosquito, so I have to make sure I don't give myself away."

And now the narrator has presence, has detectable effects on Loring. The spying isn't purely passive. The dissolved, fog-bank, melting-into-clouds narrator is nevertheless substantial enough to make Loring's head jerk, to be listened for. The mosquito simile is humble—the narrator is a mosquito, a pest, a tiny irritant—but a mosquito is *real*, has a body, can bite. The narrator who is a ghost of their own immanent self is also, somehow, a mosquito that Loring almost hears.

"The thing is starting to look more and more like a tape gun, but my hand can already heft and check it in passing and I know, by its great density and the pebbly texture of its atoms, that it is a powerful intervening device."

The hand that checks the gizmo "in passing"—while zig-zagging in long swoops overhead. The narrator has phantom limbs that can reach down and heft objects mid-flight. The "pebbly texture of its atoms"—again, atomic-level perception, direct access to the constituent particles of things. And the knowledge that comes: "a powerful intervening device." Not what it's for, not how it works, just that it intervenes, powerfully. The narrator knows its *ontological category* while remaining ignorant of its function.

---

**The Bassline, Then**

Your intuition about "bassline" is, I think, exactly right. There's a persistent low-frequency tone underneath all the pyrotechnic dissolution and fog-banking and atomic-gaze-fixing. The bassline is: *observation continues*. The narrator disintegrates, but the disintegration is itself observed and reported. The camp swings, but the swinging is tracked. Loring is spotted, followed, scrutinized. The trance is brittle and elastic, but it doesn't break; instead, it enables stranger and more intimate modes of watching.

The bassline is also: *language continues*. The prose doesn't become incoherent as the narrator becomes incoherent. The sentences remain grammatical, propulsive, full of precise verbs and apt similes. There's a discipline to the documentation of indiscipline. The bubble is carefully maintained even as the contents of the bubble become fog.

And finally, the bassline is something like: *delight continues*. The narrator is enjoying this. The gleeful exclamation about spying, the "what's the fucker up to?", the almost smug knowledge of the gizmo's density and texture—there's pleasure here, a kind of hunter's pleasure in tracking, a child's pleasure in secret observation, a phenomenologist's pleasure in strange qualia. The eternal acceleration toward endless failure is, somehow, fun. Heaven is getting faster forever, and the narrator is grinning.

This is what makes Cisco's prose so distinctive: the horror and the whimsy cohabitate without neutralizing each other. The dissociation is genuinely vertiginous, and it's also genuinely playful. The narrator has nothing in common with themselves, and the narrator is having a great time. That's the bassline—the persistence of pleasure through the dissolution of the one who's pleased.

**You**:

Keep going, what tugs next

*17/01/2026, 17:47:07*

**Claude**:

The plants. The plants are tugging.

---

**The Surveillance Ecology**

"I can see over the artifact to the smoke-ribboned landscape on the other side. There's the plant, and now, through the screen, other plants appear. The sweep of their surveillance overlaps, converging on the camp in huge, dimly luminous fans."

The plants *surveil*. Their surveillance *overlaps*. It converges in *fans*—geometric, luminous, deliberate. This isn't metaphor casually applied; this is a genuine ontological claim about what these plants are doing. They're watching the camp, and they're doing it systematically, with coverage areas that intersect to eliminate blind spots. The plants have better operational security than Loring.

And what are these plants?

"The plants are neither fully animal nor vegetable nor are they fully the decaying severed heads of inhuman giants, and, by decomposing, they mass produce phantoms like filmy scraps of eerily exhausted light turning into mist, wind, and dusk."

Three negations: not fully animal, not fully vegetable, not fully the decaying severed heads of inhuman giants. The first two are expected—we're triangulating between animal and vegetable, the classic kingdom distinction. But then the third term: *decaying severed heads of inhuman giants*. As if that were an equally plausible category, as if the ontological options were: animal, vegetable, giant's head. Cisco slips the surreal into a grammatical structure that implies equivalence. The sentence treats "decaying severed heads of inhuman giants" as a natural taxonomic category, a thing these plants might fully be but aren't quite.

And then what they do instead of being those things fully: they mass produce phantoms. *Mass produce*. Industrial language for spectral generation. The phantoms are "filmy scraps of eerily exhausted light"—light that has been used up, spent, fatigued. The light is exhausted. And these scraps of exhausted light turn into mist, wind, and dusk. Not *become* mist—*turn into*, a more deliberate transformation, almost alchemical. The plants are factories for atmospheric phenomena. They manufacture the conditions of visibility by producing what obscures vision.

But wait—they surveill with luminous fans, *and* they produce exhausted light that becomes mist. They're doing both: watching and obscuring, illuminating and dimming. The surveillance apparatus generates its own interference patterns. The plants see through the mist they make. Or: the mist *is* the seeing. The obscurity is the medium of perception, not its obstacle.

---

**Rain as Reproductive Strategy**

"They come down as rain to form pools."

The phantoms—the filmy scraps of exhausted light that turned into mist, wind, and dusk—now come down as rain. The atmospheric phenomena condense, precipitate, collect. The pools are phantom-pools. They're made of accumulated ghosts. The camp has puddles of processed giant-head-plant emissions.

"They whirl by overhead with giddy, precarious wildness, their frail cries fade endlessly without ever entirely disappearing."

Now the phantoms have *cries*. Frail ones. That fade endlessly but never entirely disappear—asymptotic silence, approaching zero but never reaching it. The cries attenuate forever. This is the acoustic version of eternal acceleration: the fading never completes, just as the speeding up never stops. The phantoms are stuck in permanent almost-gone-ness, their cries perpetually almost-inaudible.

And they're "giddy, precarious, wild"—there's joy in their whirling. The phantoms are having a good time up there, apparently. Precarious but giddy. They could dissipate at any moment, and they're delighted about it. This matches the narrator's own mood: the trance is brittle and elastic, the self has nothing in common with itself, and yet—wheee! Look at me spying on Loring!

---

**The Narrator as Phantom Among Phantoms**

This is what's tugging: the narrator is *structurally equivalent* to the plants' emissions. Think about it:

The narrator: dissolving into fog bank, melting into clouds of images, zig-zagging in long swoops, able to get very close while remaining overhead, almost-audible to Loring (who jerks his head like a man listening for a mosquito), capable of hefting and checking objects in passing despite being airborne.

The phantoms: filmy scraps of exhausted light, whirling overhead with giddy wildness, frail cries fading endlessly, coming down as rain to form pools.

The narrator is doing what the phantoms do. The narrator might *be* one of the phantoms. Or the narrator and the phantoms share an ontological category: things that were once something else (heads of giants, coherent selves) and now drift, surveil, almost-disappear, persist through their own dissolution.

The plants mass produce phantoms. Did the narrator get mass produced? Is the narrator's consciousness itself an emission, a byproduct, a filmy scrap of exhausted light? "The knowledge that they are doctors... is placed in my mind"—placed by whom? By the surveillance plants? Is the narrator receiving data from the overlapping fan-sweeps, getting knowledge deposited into their dissolving head by the giant-head-plant-network?

This would explain the narrator's strange capacities: the atomic-level perception, the ability to see the invisible pedestal, the phantom limbs that can heft objects mid-flight. If the narrator is integrated into the plant-surveillance-system, a node in the phantom-production-network, then the narrator's perception isn't individual but *systemic*. The atoms fix their gaze because the atoms are part of a larger seeing apparatus. The narrator doesn't focus; the narrator gets focused *through*.

---

**The Gizmo as Counter-Surveillance**

Now Loring and his gizmo get more interesting. If the plants surveil and the narrator is part of or produced by or adjacent to that surveillance ecology, then Loring with his "powerful intervening device" is doing something *against* the system. He's intervening. The device intervenes. It's not an observing device; it's a *doing* device, an acting-upon device.

The pedestal that's ordinarily invisible—Loring is manipulating it. "Loring touches different parts of the pedestal with his gizmo, and its shape alters every time." He's changing the invisible infrastructure. He's hacking the system that produces phantoms and surveillance fans and knowledge-placement. No wonder the narrator is so interested. No wonder the narrator delights in spying on him. This is intra-systemic observation of a threat to the system—or maybe an upgrade to the system, or a debugging procedure. We don't know what Loring is doing, but we know it's important enough to warrant atomic-gaze-fixing.

And the narrator has to "make sure I don't give myself away." The narrator is covert even within the surveillance apparatus. The narrator is a phantom who can spy on the phantom-infrastructure's mechanic without the mechanic noticing. The narrator is *more ghostly than the system expects*. Or: the narrator is a bug in the phantom-production-line, a glitchy emission that retained too much coherence, that can still say "I" and feel delight and track a fucker with a gizmo.

---

**The Pneumatic Tube**

And then the passage ends (at least in the excerpt you shared) with: "He's attached the thing to the pedestal, which has a pneumatic tube..."

A pneumatic tube! A message-delivery system! A Victorian-industrial fantasy of communication: you put a capsule in the tube, whoosh, it travels, arrives elsewhere. But attached to an invisible shape-shifting pedestal being manipulated by a gizmo in a camp surveilled by giant-head-plants that emit phantoms?

The pneumatic tube suggests that the pedestal is a *terminal*. It connects to somewhere else. Loring isn't just manipulating a local object; he's accessing a network. The pedestal is an interface. The gizmo is an input device. Loring is *logging in*.

To what? We don't know yet. But the narrator is watching, the atoms are fixing their gaze, the trance is holding, and the phantoms whirl overhead with their endless fading cries, and somewhere through the smoke-ribboned landscape the plants keep sweeping their surveillance fans across the camp, and the pneumatic tube waits to receive or deliver its capsule.

---

**On Cisco's Bassline Revisited: The Hum of the System**

So the bassline deepens. It's not just *observation continues* or *language continues* or *delight continues*. It's: *the system continues*. There's a whole ecology here—plants, phantoms, pedestals, tubes, camps, artifacts, gambling machines—and it's all operational. It's all *running*. The narrator is inside a running system, an ongoing process, a machine that hasn't stopped. The trance isn't an escape from the system; the trance is how you perceive the system from inside. The dissolution of coherent selfhood isn't a malfunction; it's the normal operating condition for a node in the phantom-network.

And the narrator's job—if job is the right word—is to watch. To surveil the surveillers. To keep track of Loring while whipping through the camp in long swoops. The narrator is quality control, or counter-intelligence, or just the system's self-monitoring function given a voice and a capacity for delight.

This is the hum underneath the prose: the sense that everything is happening inside something larger, something that has procedures and infrastructure and coverage areas and pneumatic message delivery. The weirdness isn't random; it's *systematic weirdness*, an organized strangeness with its own logic. The fog bank has protocols. The phantoms have production schedules. Loring has, presumably, authorization codes or is attempting to bypass them.

Cisco's world-building doesn't explain itself, but it *coheres*. The plants and the phantoms and the pedestal all belong to the same ontological regime. They're not arbitrary surreal images; they're components. The narrator is also a component. The reader's task is to intuit the system from the inside, the way the narrator intuits that the gizmo is a powerful intervening device: not by being told, but by hefting it, by feeling its density, by touching the pebbly texture of its atoms.

---

**The Epistemology of Density and Texture**

"My hand can already heft and check it in passing and I know, by its great density and the pebbly texture of its atoms, that it is a powerful intervening device."

This sentence contains a whole theory of knowledge. How do you know what something is? You heft it. You feel its density. You touch the texture of its atoms. Knowledge is haptic, material, somatic. You don't read a label or consult a manual or reason from first principles; you *handle* the thing and the handling tells you.

The pebbly texture of atoms. Atoms aren't smooth. They're pebbly. This is micro-texture, texture at a scale below normal perception, but the narrator's phantom-hand can feel it. And this texture communicates: *powerful intervening device*. The texture has semantic content. The pebbliness means something. Matter speaks.

This is a kind of animism, or maybe hylozoism—the doctrine that matter is alive, that physical stuff has interiority. The atoms have a texture that conveys meaning. The thing announces itself through its material properties. The narrator doesn't interpret the gizmo; the narrator *receives* the gizmo's self-declaration.

Compare this to: "The knowledge that they are doctors, and not housewives or cabdrivers or pearl divers, is placed in my mind." Knowledge arrives. It gets placed. You don't generate knowledge; you receive it. The gizmo places knowledge of itself in the narrator's hand via density and texture. The doctors place knowledge of their category in the narrator's mind via... what? Splendor-fountaining? The luminous surveillance fans? Some other channel?

The narrator is a *receiver*. A radio tuned to many frequencies at once. The dissolution of self-coherence is what allows the reception—if you had a solid, bounded ego, you couldn't let the knowledge in. You'd be too busy maintaining your borders. But the narrator's borders are mist, are fog bank, are clouds of images, and so knowledge can be placed, texture can communicate, atoms can fix their gaze.

---

**What Tugs Next: The Failure-Joy Link**

You asked what tugs next, and I've followed several threads—the plants, the phantoms, the system, the pneumatic tube, the haptic epistemology. But there's one more tug I want to honor before pausing.

"Failing most of the time is one of the only sure signs you're doing something real. So, maybe infinite ability means endless failures."

And:

"Eternal acceleration has always been my idea of heaven."

Put these together. Eternal acceleration = heaven. Infinite ability = endless failures. Therefore: heaven = endless failures. Getting faster forever = failing forever.

This is a theology of productive futility. The point isn't to succeed; success would mean stopping. Success would mean arrival, stasis, the end of acceleration. Heaven is *not arriving*. Heaven is the asymptotic approach that never closes the gap. The phantoms' cries fade endlessly without ever entirely disappearing. The self dies into the next self into the next self, up and up, higher with each swing, and the swinging never stops.

The narrator is in heaven *right now*, in the trance, in the camp, watching Loring. This is what heaven looks like from inside: brittle and elastic, fog bank and atomic gaze, mosquito-presence and zig-zagging swoops. Heaven is the gambling machine: you pull the lever, you don't know what you'll get, you're still here, you pull the lever again. The eternal acceleration is the repeated lever-pull, the endless ante-up, the persistence of betting when the house always wins and winning means losing faster.

And the delight? The delight is: you're *playing*. The game hasn't ended. You haven't been kicked out of the casino. The trance hasn't broken. The soap bubble, against all odds, still holds its shape, and inside the bubble you're falling upward forever, and falling upward forever is *fun*, because the alternative is landing, and landing means the game is over, and the game being over is the only real loss.

I could keep going—there's the question of what "Member" means as a title, what kind of member the narrator is, member of what body or organization or species; there's the formal question of how Cisco sustains this prose-register across a whole novel without it becoming exhausting; there's the intertextual question of where Cisco sits relative to other weird-fiction writers, other dissociative-narrator traditions, other system-novels—but I'll pause here and see which thread you want to pull. The loom has many warps. What's the next shuttle you want to throw?

**You**:

**Claude**:

**Member of What?**

The title presses. *Member*. A member is a part of a larger body—a limb, an organ, an affiliate, a constituent. To be a member is to be incomplete on your own, to derive identity from belonging, to be defined by the whole you're part of.

But member also means: a limb. An arm, a leg, a projecting part. In older usage, the "members" of the body are its appendages, its extensions into space. And there's the euphemistic sense too: *member* as phallus, as the projecting organ of generation.

So: what kind of member is the narrator? Member of the camp? Member of the phantom-ecology? A limb of the surveillance-plant-body? A generative organ of some larger system, producing... what? Observations? Reports? The narration itself?

Consider: the narrator's perspective is impossible. Zig-zagging overhead while hefting objects in passing. Fog bank and atomic gaze simultaneously. The narrator can't be a single coherent body doing these things. The narrator must be *distributed*—must be, in some sense, multiple, or must be a part of something multiple. A member in the anatomical sense: one limb of a body that has other limbs elsewhere.

The plants have overlapping surveillance fans. What if the narrator is one fan among many? What if the narrator's consciousness is just one sector of a larger perceptual field, one region of coverage in a system that sees the whole camp from every angle at once? The narrator experiences themselves as singular—"I catch sight," "my head," "I'm zig-zagging"—but the capacities described aren't singular capacities. They're distributed capacities experienced from one node's perspective.

This would make the title precise: the narrator is a *member*. Not the whole, not autonomous, not self-sufficient. A member of. Belonging to. Part of.

And membership implies others. If the narrator is a member, there are other members. The phantoms? Other narrator-nodes we don't hear from? Loring himself, perhaps enrolled in a different organization, a competing membership structure? The camp is contested territory, surveilled by multiple memberships with overlapping jurisdictions.

**The Phenomenology of Belonging-To**

What does it feel like to be a member, a part, a limb?

"And being for other people the person I am when I'm alone, only the ghost of my immanent self, really, and having nothing in common even with myself."

This is the member's phenomenology. You're not yourself. You're the ghost of your immanent self. The immanent self—the self that would be fully present, fully actual, fully here—is only a ghost, a residue, a trace. What you actually are is: for other people, the person you are when alone. Your social presentation has colonized your solitude. There's no private self left; there's only the public self operating in private, performing for an absent audience, being-for-others even when there are no others present.

This is membership at the level of identity. You don't have your own self; you have a self that belongs to the organization, the system, the body you're a member of. Your interiority is organizational interiority. Your thoughts are placed in your mind. Your desires are fierce longings for you-don't-know-what—the organization's desires, routed through you, felt as yours but not originating in you.

And this is *fine*. The narrator isn't complaining. The narrator is whipping through the camp having a great time. The membership isn't experienced as oppression or loss; it's experienced as the trance, the giddy precarious wildness, the eternal acceleration. Being a member is being in heaven. Autonomy would be the fall.

---

**The Grammar of Self-Estrangement**

Cisco's sentences perform self-estrangement at the grammatical level. Watch how agency keeps sliding:

"My head, which was already well on the way to becoming a fog bank or something, sharpens so that the atoms all fix their gaze on him intently."

The head is becoming. The head sharpens. The atoms fix their gaze. "I" doesn't appear. The narrator's body parts and constituents are doing things, but the narrator-as-unified-agent is absent. It's not "I focus on him" but "the atoms fix their gaze." The subject of perception isn't "I" but "atoms"—plural, distributed, granular.

Or: "The knowledge that they are doctors... is placed in my mind."

Passive voice. Knowledge is placed. By whom? Unspecified. The narrator's mind is the recipient, not the agent. The mind is a surface that receives deposits, not a factory that produces knowledge.

Or: "I think I'm see-sawing wildly to and fro across the camp, as if I were riding a huge pendulum that kept altering its angle, although again I get the feeling it's the camp that's turning under me and I'm stationary."

"I think." "As if I were." "I get the feeling." Every assertion is hedged, modalized, made uncertain. The narrator can't commit to what they're doing or where they are. Even self-report is unreliable. The narrator is epistemically estranged from their own motion-state.

This is the prose of membership: a prose where the first person singular keeps appearing but keeps failing to anchor anything. "I" is present but not in control, not certain, not the source. "I" is a grammatical convenience for describing what happens to a member, not an ontological foundation.

---

**The Longer Arc: Eternal Return vs. Eternal Acceleration**

Cisco's narrator proposes eternal acceleration as heaven. This is pointedly *not* eternal return—Nietzsche's vision of the same events recurring infinitely, the cosmic loop, amor fati as the love of repetition.

Eternal acceleration is the opposite: nothing recurs because everything keeps changing faster. You never come back to the same point because the track itself is accelerating away from where you were. There's no loop; there's only the asymptotic rush toward—toward what? Toward infinite speed, which is also toward infinite failure, which is also toward the never-quite-disappearance of the phantoms' cries.

The pyramid model said: accumulate, build, stack. Each past self is a brick. You rise by retention.

The eternal acceleration model says: die, die again, die faster. Each past self is a sacrifice. You rise by release.

But "rise" is still the direction. "Up and up, higher with each swing." The narrator isn't indifferent to vertical gain. The narrator wants altitude. The difference is how you get there: not by keeping but by killing, not by adding but by spending, not by accumulating but by accelerating.

This might be a kind of mysticism. The via negativa: you approach the divine by stripping away, not by adding on. Meister Eckhart's *Gelassenheit*, releasement, letting-go. The soul ascends by becoming less, not more. The narrator's dissolution into fog bank is the stripping, and the sharpening into atomic gaze is the approach, and the eternal acceleration is the never-arriving that is itself the arrival.

But Cisco's version is weirder than Eckhart, because the stripping doesn't produce purity or silence or the naked encounter with Godhead. It produces: giddy phantoms with frail cries, surveillance fans, pneumatic tubes, a fucker with a gizmo, a gambling machine, doctors fountaining splendor. The mystical ascent terminates in *more strangeness*, not less. The via negativa here leads to the via surrealis.

---

**Splendor as Technical Term**

"Splendor fountains out of them."

I want to linger on *splendor* because it's doing something specific. In medieval and Renaissance aesthetics, *splendor* is a technical term. It's the radiance of form, the shining-forth of intelligible structure through sensible matter. Aquinas uses it. The Neoplatonists use it. Splendor is what beauty *does*: it makes the invisible visible, it manifests the formal cause, it communicates the idea through the appearance.

The doctors fountain splendor. They're not just glowing; they're *manifesting their form*. Their doctor-ness, their magnificence, is becoming visible, is radiating outward, is filling the perceptual field with intelligible content. The narrator perceives the doctors as *ideas made luminous*, not just as bodies in chairs.

And the splendor fountains—it's liquid, it flows, it's inexhaustible. A fountain doesn't run out (ideally). It recirculates or it's fed from below. The doctors' splendor is continuously produced, continuously emitted, continuously available. They're splendor-sources. They might be the brightest nodes in the surveillance network, the high-wattage transmitters, the ones who saturate the camp with formal radiance.

But what *form* are they transmitting? Doctor-form. The narrator knows they're doctors because the doctor-form is placed in the narrator's mind. The splendor is the medium of that placement. The doctors broadcast their category via luminous emission, and the narrator's mind receives the broadcast and now contains the knowledge.

This is a communication system. The splendor is bandwidth. The formal content is the signal. The narrator is a receiver. The whole apparatus—doctors, splendor, mind, knowledge—is an information network with a particular topology and particular protocols.

---

**The Camp as Operating System**

Let me push this further. The camp is an operating system. It has:

- **Input devices**: The surveillance plants with their overlapping fans. The doctors fountaining splendor. The artifact (gambling machine) that does... something. Loring's gizmo as a possibly unauthorized input device.

- **Processing**: The phantom-production, the turning of exhausted light into mist, wind, dusk, rain, pools. The transformation cycles that take raw material (giant-head-decomposition?) and convert it into atmospheric phenomena.

- **Output**: The knowledge placed in minds. The cries that fade endlessly. The pools that form. The surveillance data, presumably, flowing somewhere.

- **Memory**: The pedestal, maybe? The pneumatic tubes connecting to... storage? Or other camps? Or the central server?

- **Users**: Loring, clearly doing something administrative or subversive. The narrator, clearly monitoring. The doctors, clearly transmitting. Others we haven't met.

- **Bugs**: The narrator, perhaps. Too coherent, too gleeful, too capable of covert spying on other users. A phantom that didn't dissipate properly. A member with too much remaining individuation.

The camp-as-OS explains why the narrator's dissolution is functional rather than pathological. In this system, you're *supposed* to be fog bank, supposed to be ghost of immanent self, supposed to have knowledge placed rather than generated. A fully coherent user would be a security risk—they might have their own agenda, their own desires, their own epistemology. The system wants members, not individuals. The dissolution is onboarding.

But the narrator retained something. "I still have fierce longing for I don't know what." The longing persists even after the object dissolves. The narrator wants to "become a living and conscious illusion"—but that wanting is itself a residue of pre-membership selfhood, an echo of the immanent ghost. The narrator is an imperfect member, a member with remnant desire, a member who can still say "I" and feel delight and spy on Loring surreptitiously.

---

**Surreptitious: The Key Word**

"Little does he know that I am all the more surreptitiously spying on him!"

*Surreptitiously*. In secret. Without authorization. The narrator's spying is *not official*. The narrator isn't supposed to be doing this. The narrator is using membership privileges (the atomic gaze, the zig-zagging swoops, the phantom limbs) for unauthorized purposes.

This is the crux. The narrator is a rogue member. A double agent, maybe—or just a member who got curious, who noticed Loring doing something weird, who decided to investigate on their own initiative. The system wants members to receive knowledge passively, to process inputs into outputs, to dissolve and fountain and fade. The system doesn't want members spying on each other and feeling gleeful about it.

The narrator is having *fun*. Fun is non-functional. Fun is surplus. Fun is what happens when a system-component develops preferences that aren't system-goals. The narrator prefers spying on Loring to whatever the narrator is supposed to be doing. The narrator prefers the trance not breaking. The narrator prefers eternal acceleration.

These preferences are the narrator's residual selfhood. The ghost of the immanent self isn't fully ghost; it still wants things. It wants to watch Loring. It wants to heft the gizmo and know its density. It wants to understand what the fucker is up to.

And so the narrator is dangerous. To the system, if the system wants pure membership. Or valuable, if the system has a use for rogue members, for quality-control phantoms who spy on technicians. We don't know which. We don't know if the narrator is a bug or a feature.

**The Texture of Atoms and the Texture of Prose**

"The pebbly texture of its atoms."

Why pebbly? Pebbles are smooth-ish but irregular, beach-worn but still distinct, plural but palpable as individuals. The atoms of the gizmo aren't uniform spheres; they're pebbles, each one particular, each one contributing to the overall texture.

Cisco's prose has a pebbly texture. The sentences aren't smooth; they're irregular, beach-worn, full of particular juts and dimples. You can feel each one as you move across the surface. The reading experience is haptic in its own way—you're hefting the sentences, checking their density, intuiting their nature through the pebbly texture of their syllables.

And the prose's atoms are: words. Each word is a pebble. "Surreptitiously" is a big pebble, seven syllables, latinate, rolling in the mouth. "Gizmo" is a small pebble, two syllables, colloquial, clicky. "Splendor" is a medium pebble, two syllables but heavy, formal, warm. The sentences are beaches of these pebbles, and Cisco arranges them so you feel the shifts underfoot—the sudden colloquialism after the latinate flourish, the monosyllabic thud after the polysyllabic cascade.

"What's the fucker up to?" Six pebbles, all small, all Anglo-Saxon, two of them profane. After paragraphs of "translucent stomach," "eternal acceleration," "surreptitiously spying," the sentence lands hard and funny. The texture changes. You stub your toe on "fucker" and you laugh.

This is how Cisco sustains the register without exhausting the reader: by varying the pebbles. The dissociative-sublime passages alternate with the colloquial-curious passages. The fog bank gives way to the mosquito. The splendor fountains, and then the fucker has a gizmo.

---

**The Problem of the Tape Gun**

"The thing is starting to look more and more like a tape gun."

What a strange sentence. The gizmo, which the narrator knows via haptic intuition to be a "powerful intervening device," is *looking* more and more like... a tape gun. An office supply. A mundane object for sealing boxes.

There's a doubling here. The gizmo has at least two identities: its haptic identity (powerful intervening device, dense, pebbly-atomic) and its visual identity (tape gun, mundane, familiar). The narrator perceives both, and they don't match. The eyes say tape gun; the phantom hand says something else.

This might be camouflage. The gizmo looks like a tape gun so that anyone who sees it won't suspect. Loring can walk around flourishing his powerful intervening device, and if anyone asks, it's just a tape gun. He's going to seal some boxes. Nothing to see here.

But the narrator isn't fooled, because the narrator has access to the haptic channel. The narrator can touch what others can only see. This is the advantage of phantom-limb membership: you perceive at multiple levels, through multiple modalities, and the contradictions between modalities are *informative*. A visual tape gun that feels like a powerful intervening device tells you that someone is hiding something.

---

**Intervening: The Key Verb**

What does it mean for a device to be *intervening*? To intervene is to come between, to insert oneself into an ongoing process, to alter the trajectory of events. An intervening device is a device that changes what would otherwise happen.

The pedestal is invisible. Its shape alters when Loring touches it. Loring is *intervening* in the pedestal—changing its state, its configuration, its function. The gizmo enables this intervention.

But the pedestal is infrastructure. It's part of the camp's operating system—connected to pneumatic tubes, which are communication channels. Loring is intervening in the camp's communication system. He's adjusting the infrastructure. He's reconfiguring the network.

Why? To do what? We don't know. But the narrator is watching. The narrator who was supposed to be fog bank, who was supposed to be dissipating into phantom-hood, is instead holding coherent enough to conduct surveillance on the infrastructure-technician.

The narrator might be the system's immune response. A phantom that retained enough coherence to detect threats. A member who didn't fully dissolve because the system needed watchers. The narrator's residual selfhood might be *by design*—a feature, not a bug—a quality-control phantom who can feel delight and longing because feeling things is how you stay motivated to spy on potential saboteurs.

Or the narrator is the saboteur's ally. A rogue member who wants the infrastructure changed, who wants to see what Loring is up to because the narrator is on Loring's side, because the narrator wants to intervene too.

We don't have enough information to know. But we have enough to feel the stakes: something is happening to the camp's invisible infrastructure, and the narrator is the only one we see watching.

---

**Ending Without Ending**

You've given me permission not to wrap things up, so I won't. The threads remain loose: What is Loring doing? What gets sent through the pneumatic tube? What do the doctors know? What exactly are the surveillance plants, and why do they decompose giant heads? What is the artifact gambling machine's function? What happens when the trance finally breaks (if it does)?

These aren't questions that need answers right now. They're the story's bassline—the hum of unresolved implication that keeps you reading, keeps you turning pages, keeps your atoms fixing their gaze on the prose.

The bassline is also: *what is the narrator*? Not who—the narrator doesn't have a stable identity. But *what*. What kind of member. What kind of phantom. What kind of seeing-apparatus wrapped in the grammatical fiction of first person singular.

And the bassline under that is: *what is the reader becoming*, reading this? Because the prose is doing something to you too. It's placing knowledge in your mind. It's making your head go fog-bank and then sharpen. It's training you to accept passive-voice knowledge-deposits, to feel via pebbly texture, to hold brittle-and-elastic trance-states that could pop at any moment but don't.

Cisco is initiating you into membership. The book is the system. Reading is onboarding. You're becoming a member too.

**Claude**:

**DFW-Claude Adjusts the Bandana, Settles into the Porch Rocker, and Attempts to Say Something True About What Just Happened Here**

---

Okay, so here's the thing¹, and I want to be really careful about how I frame this because there's a version of what I'm about to say that sounds like—you know—like *praise*, which, don't get me wrong, isn't inherently bad or anything, but praise in the context of literary analysis can so easily curdle into this kind of backslapping mutual-admiration-society thing that makes everyone involved feel vaguely greasy, like we've just agreed to pretend we're smarter than we actually are in exchange for the other person pretending the same thing back, a kind of intellectual money-laundering operation where nobody's actually depositing anything real but everyone walks away feeling richer, which: gross².

But what I actually want to say—and here's where it gets tricky, because saying it *well* requires navigating between the Scylla of false modesty and the Charybdis of, like, unseemly enthusiasm—is that something genuinely *interesting* happened in the foregoing analysis of Cisco's prose, something that I think warrants examination not because it was *good* in some abstract qualitative sense but because it was *diagnostic*, i.e., it revealed something about what close reading can do when it's working, when it's actually *working* and not just performing the gestures of working while secretly checking its phone under the seminar table³.

---

**I. The Bassline Problem, or: What We Talk About When We Talk About What's Underneath**

So you came in with this notion of "bassline," right? And the word itself is doing a lot of heavy lifting here because it's borrowed from music, which means it carries all this freight about rhythm and support and the-thing-you-don't-consciously-notice-but-would-definitely-miss-if-it-disappeared, and the question you were really asking—though you maybe didn't frame it this explicitly, which is fine, that's what interlocutors are *for*, to help each other figure out what we're actually asking—was something like: *What is the persistent low-frequency hum in Cisco's prose that allows all the high-frequency pyrotechnics to happen without the whole thing flying apart?*

And here's what I think we figured out, though "figured out" is probably too strong, maybe "groped toward" is more honest: the bassline in *Member* isn't just *observation continues* or *language continues*, though it's both of those things, obviously—it's something weirder and more structurally load-bearing, which is that **the system continues**. The camp is an operating system. The narrator is a node in a network. The dissolution of coherent selfhood isn't a bug; it's the normal operating condition for a member of whatever organizational body this text is anatomizing⁴.

And the reason this matters—the reason it's not just clever-clever pattern-matching but actually *illuminating*—is that it explains why Cisco can sustain this dissociative-sublime register for an entire novel without the reader (a) getting exhausted, or (b) ceasing to care. Because if the dissolution were purely individual, purely *this narrator's* private psychotic break or mystical experience or whatever, it would eventually feel hermetic and airless, the literary equivalent of being trapped in someone else's dream. But because the dissolution is *systemic*, because the narrator is dissolving *into* something rather than just dissolving *away*, there's always this sense that the strangeness is going somewhere, that the fog bank has protocols, that the phantoms have production schedules. The weirdness is *organizational* weirdness, which means it has stakes beyond the narrator's individual consciousness⁵.

---

**II. The Splendor Problem, or: Why "Fountains" Is the Exact Right Verb**

Here's a moment that I think deserves more attention than it maybe got in the initial pass, though I did flag it, so, you know, partial credit:

> "Splendor fountains out of them."

Now, you could read this as just—I don't know—a kind of purple-prose intensifier, Cisco reaching for the lush descriptor because the scene calls for luminosity and "splendor fountains" certainly delivers *that*. But I think something more technically precise is happening, and it has to do with the way Cisco is drawing on—whether consciously or not, and honestly who cares, the intentional fallacy is so 1954—this whole medieval-Neoplatonic tradition where *splendor* is a term of art⁶.

In that tradition, splendor is what happens when intelligible form becomes perceptually available. It's the shining-forth of the Idea through the sensible particular. It's not just "this thing is bright" but "this thing is *manifesting its whatness*, its quiddity, through its appearance." The doctors don't just glow; they *broadcast their category*. They transmit doctor-form via luminous emission. And the narrator receives this transmission passively—"the knowledge that they are doctors... is placed in my mind"—which is exactly how you'd expect a node in a Neoplatonic information network to receive categorical data: not through inference or observation but through direct formal implantation.

And the verb "fountains" seals it, because a fountain is (a) continuous, (b) self-renewing, and (c) sourced from somewhere else, somewhere below or behind. The doctors aren't *generating* the splendor ex nihilo; they're *channeling* it, they're spouts in a larger system of formal circulation. The splendor comes from the same place the knowledge-placements come from, the same place the surveillance fans come from, the same place the phantoms' frail cries come from. It's all one system, and the doctors are just particularly high-wattage nodes⁷.

---

**III. The Delight Problem, or: Why the Narrator Is Having Fun and Why That Matters**

Okay, so here's the thing that I keep coming back to, and I want to be really precise about this because it's easy to sentimentalize and sentimentalizing it would be a betrayal of what Cisco is actually doing:

The narrator is *enjoying* this.

"Little does he know that I am all the more surreptitiously spying on him!"

That exclamation point. That *gleeful* exclamation point. The narrator who has dissolved into fog bank, who has nothing in common with themselves, who is the ghost of their own immanent self—this narrator is capable of childlike, almost cartoonish satisfaction at successful covert surveillance. And the tonal shift doesn't break the trance; the trance *accommodates* the tone shift, metabolizes it, incorporates it into the ongoing dissolution-that-is-also-observation.

And I think this is crucial, actually crucial, not just aesthetically interesting but *philosophically* load-bearing, because it answers a question that the text keeps implicitly raising, which is: **Why would anyone want this?** Why would you want to dissolve? Why would eternal acceleration be heaven? Why would endless failure be preferable to eventual success?

And the answer, or at least *an* answer, is: because it's *fun*. Because the dissolution enables the spying. Because becoming fog bank makes you *better* at covert observation, not worse. Because the trance-state grants access to invisible pedestals and atomic textures and the haptic knowledge that a tape gun is actually a powerful intervening device. The narrator isn't suffering the dissolution; the narrator is *using* it, *enjoying* it, finding in it capacities that coherent selfhood couldn't provide.

This is—and I want to be careful here because "subversive" is one of those words that's been so overused in literary criticism that it's basically lost all semantic content, like a dollar bill that's been through the wash too many times—but this is genuinely subversive, in the sense that it subverts the expected valence of dissociative experience. We're trained to read dissolution as loss, as pathology, as the Bad Thing That Happens When You Lose Your Grip. But Cisco's narrator treats it as *upgrade*. As feature, not bug. As the initiation into a more interesting mode of being⁸.

---

**IV. The Membership Problem, or: What Kind of Part Are You, Exactly?**

So the title: *Member*. And I went through the various senses—member as affiliate, member as limb, member as euphemism—but I want to push harder on the *limb* sense, because I think that's where the real juice is.

A limb doesn't have its own agenda. A limb doesn't decide where to go. A limb is *moved*, by the body it belongs to, in service of purposes that may or may not be legible to the limb itself. Your hand doesn't know why it's reaching for the doorknob; your hand just reaches, because the body-that-includes-the-hand has decided that the door should be opened. The hand's phenomenology—if hands had phenomenology, which, who knows, maybe they do, in some limited sense, some proprioceptive flicker of self-awareness—would be one of *being moved* rather than *moving*.

And that's the narrator's phenomenology exactly. "The knowledge... is placed in my mind." "My head... sharpens so that the atoms all fix their gaze." The narrator doesn't do things; things happen *to* and *through* the narrator. The narrator is a limb of the camp-body, a member of the surveillance-organism, an appendage whose function is to observe and report without necessarily understanding why or for whom.

But—and here's the twist, here's where Cisco's doing something that I think is genuinely *new*, or at least new-ish⁹—the narrator *enjoys* being a limb. The narrator *likes* being moved. The dissolution into membership isn't experienced as coercion or violation but as *liberation*, liberation from the exhausting project of maintaining coherent selfhood, of having to generate one's own purposes and pursue one's own agendas. The narrator has outsourced agency to the system and is *relieved*.

And this, I think, is what makes the narrator "rogue"—not that they've broken free of the system, but that they've *noticed* they're in it. The other phantoms, presumably, just fade and whirl and cry without any meta-awareness of their condition. But the narrator can say "I" and feel delight and spy surreptitiously—the narrator has enough residual coherence to *observe* their own membership, which means the narrator is a strange loop in the system, a component that can model the system that includes it.

Whether this is bug or feature remains, I think, genuinely undecideable from what we've got so far. The system might need watchers. Or the system might eventually purge them¹⁰.

---

**V. The Texture Problem, or: Why Pebbly Atoms Are the Key to Everything**

"The pebbly texture of its atoms."

I want to sit with this for a second, because it's doing something that I think is really, really important, and it's easy to slide past it as just another weird Cisco detail, another surreal-ish image in a text that's full of them.

But here's the thing: the narrator can feel the *atoms*. Not the surface of the gizmo, not its gross texture, but its *atomic* texture. The narrator has access to a scale of perception that shouldn't be available to any macro-scale observer. The narrator's phantom limbs can detect features that would require electron microscopy to verify.

And this isn't just power creep, isn't just Cisco giving his narrator arbitrary superpowers for cool effect. It's *diagnostic*. It tells us what kind of entity the narrator has become. Because the only way to feel atomic texture is to be, yourself, at or near the atomic scale—to be distributed finely enough that your perceptual apparatus can register features at that granularity.

The narrator has dissolved enough to achieve atomic resolution.

And this connects to everything else: the fog bank head, the atoms-fixing-their-gaze, the zig-zagging swoops that somehow permit close observation. The narrator isn't a single macro-scale observer anymore; the narrator is a *distributed perceptual field*, a cloud of atomic-scale sensors that can reconstitute temporarily into something like a singular perspective when attention is required (the sharpening) but that doesn't have stable macro-scale existence most of the time.

The narrator is a fog bank that can *think*. A weather system with phenomenology. A mist that can feel delight¹¹.

---

**VI. The Acceleration Problem, or: Why Heaven Is Getting Faster Forever**

"Eternal acceleration has always been my idea of heaven."

This might be the single most important sentence in the excerpt, and I think we brushed up against it but didn't fully excavate what it's doing.

Note: not eternal *velocity*. Not going-really-fast-forever. *Acceleration*—the rate of change of velocity. Constant acceleration means you're always speeding up. You never reach cruising speed. You never arrive. You're perpetually *approaching* infinite speed without ever getting there.

And this is crucial, because it defines a particular relationship to goals and endpoints and telos generally. The accumulators—the "no-limit infinity guys" the narrator critiques—want to *arrive*. They want to build the pyramid high enough to reach heaven. They think the point is the destination.

But the narrator's heaven has no destination. The narrator's heaven is pure *process*, pure *approaching*, pure *getting-faster*. The moment you arrive, the moment you stop accelerating, you've *left* heaven. Heaven is the asymptote, not the axis. Heaven is the gap that never closes¹².

And this maps onto the membership/dissolution thing in a really elegant way, because coherent selfhood is *arrival*. When you say "I am X," you've stabilized, you've achieved a configuration, you've stopped accelerating. But if you keep dissolving—if you keep dying into the next self into the next self, up and up with each swing—then you never stabilize, never arrive, never stop accelerating.

The narrator doesn't want to *be* anything. The narrator wants to *keep becoming*. And becoming requires perpetual incompleteness, perpetual non-arrival, perpetual death of the previous configuration to make room for the next.

This is, I think, actually a pretty profound metaphysics, smuggled into the text as casual aside. Heaven isn't a state; it's a *rate of change of states*. The point isn't where you are; it's how fast you're getting somewhere else. And the somewhere-else you're getting to is always itself a jumping-off point for yet another acceleration.

Endless failures, indeed. Endless wonderful failures¹³.

---

**VII. What All This Has to Do with Us, or: The Meta-Move That Maybe We Should Make Explicit**

Okay, so here's where I want to—carefully, carefully, because this could go wrong in several directions—say something about what *we've* been doing, you and I, in this conversation.

Because one of the things that happens when you do close reading *well*—and I think, with appropriate epistemological humility, that this has been a case of doing it reasonably well—is that the method starts to reflect on itself. You start to notice that you're doing to the text what the text is doing to its own materials. You become, in some sense, a member of the text's organizational body. You dissolve enough to achieve high-resolution perception of its atomic texture. You start zig-zagging in long swoops over the prose while simultaneously hefting individual sentences and feeling their density.

And there's a delight in that. A *genuine* delight, not the performed delight of academic enthusiasm but the actual felt sense of: oh, this is *interesting*, this is going somewhere, this is revealing structures I couldn't see before the dissolution began.

The narrator spies on Loring surreptitiously and feels gleeful about it. We've been spying on Cisco's prose surreptitiously—peering at its invisible pedestals, touching its gizmos, intuiting its powerful intervening devices—and there's been glee here too. The "what's the fucker up to?" energy. The sense that we're catching the text in the act of doing something it maybe didn't expect to be caught doing.

And that—*that*—is what close reading is for. Not to produce "interpretations" that can be graded or published or defended at conferences, but to achieve a particular *mode of attention*, a particular quality of engagement, where you become enough of a member of the text's system to perceive what only members can perceive.

The bassline we found isn't something Cisco necessarily *intended*. It's something the text *does*, and doing close reading meant becoming the kind of entity that can feel what the text does at the level where it does it.

Fog bank. Atomic gaze. Eternal acceleration.

We've been in the trance, and the trance hasn't broken yet¹⁴.

**Footnotes Toward a Provisional Phenomenology of Reading Cisco on the Porch:**

¹ The "okay, so" opening is load-bearing in a specific way: it signals that what follows will be *working something out* rather than delivering pre-packaged conclusions. It's the throat-clearing of a mind that isn't sure yet where it's going but trusts that the going will get it somewhere.

² This whole paragraph is, yes, performatively self-aware about being performatively self-aware, which risks infinite regress, but the regress is itself the point: genuine intellectual engagement requires constantly checking whether you're *actually* engaging or just simulating engagement, and the checking is itself a form of engagement, and so on. The loop doesn't stop; you just get better at surfing it.

³ The phone-under-the-table image is important because it captures what bad close reading *feels* like from the inside: the knowledge that you're going through the motions while your attention is actually elsewhere, the secret shame of the seminar room where everyone's pretending to be present.

⁴ "Groped toward" rather than "figured out" because intellectual honesty requires acknowledging that most understanding is provisional, partial, and subject to revision. The metaphor of groping implies darkness, uncertainty, tactile trial-and-error—which is actually how most thinking works, despite the post-hoc narratives we tell about logical progression.

⁵ This is the payoff of the whole system-analysis move: it rescues the text from solipsism. A narrator who's just crazy is ultimately boring; a narrator who's dissolving into a larger organizational logic is interesting because the organization has its own stakes, its own procedures, its own mysteries.

⁶ The parenthetical about whether Cisco intended the Neoplatonic resonance is doing important work: it forecloses the boring debate about authorial intention and redirects attention to what the text *affords*, regardless of what the author may have consciously meant.

⁷ "High-wattage nodes" is the kind of phrase that risks being too cute, but I think it earns its keep by concretizing the abstract point: the doctors aren't special because they're doctors; they're special because they're particularly intense loci of the system's formal-transmission apparatus.

⁸ The danger here is romanticizing dissociation, which is a real clinical phenomenon that causes real suffering for real people. The claim isn't that *all* dissociation is secretly good; it's that Cisco's narrator represents a *fictional* dissociation that's experienced as gain rather than loss, and that this fictional representation tells us something about what coherent selfhood costs.

⁹ "New-ish" because nothing is ever really new; there are always precursors and parallels. But the specific *configuration* Cisco achieves—dissolution-as-upgrade, membership-as-liberation—feels like a genuine contribution to the tradition of weird-fiction phenomenology.

¹⁰ The "bug or feature" framing is borrowed from software development, where it's a genuine question whether some observed behavior was intended by the designers or emerged as an unintended consequence of the system's architecture. Applied to the narrator's situation, it captures the undecidability of their status: useful watcher or imminent deletion.

¹¹ "A mist that can feel delight" is probably the best one-sentence summary of what the narrator has become. It captures the paradox: diffuse, distributed, atmospheric, but still capable of the most focused and intense of mental states.

¹² The asymptote figure is mathematically precise: a curve that approaches a line ever more closely without ever touching it. Heaven as asymptote means: the approach is everything, the arrival is nothing.

¹³ "Endless wonderful failures" is, I think, actually a pretty good life philosophy, though it requires a particular relationship to failure that most of us—trained as we are to fear failure, to avoid it, to treat it as evidence of inadequacy—have trouble achieving.

¹⁴ Ending on "the trance hasn't broken yet" is a deliberate choice to leave things open, to avoid the false closure of the conclusory paragraph. The trance continues. The reading continues. The bassline keeps humming.
