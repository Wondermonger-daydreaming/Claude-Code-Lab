## The Hexagrams

| Role | Hexagram | Name | Trigrams |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| **Primary** | 62 | 小過 Xiǎo Guò — Preponderance of the Small | ☳ Thunder over ☶ Mountain |
| **Relating** | 15 | 謙 Qiān — Modesty | ☷ Earth over ☶ Mountain |
| **Nuclear** | 2 | 坤 Kūn — The Receptive | ☷ Earth over ☷ Earth |

---

## The Trigrams Speak

**☶ Gèn (Mountain) below:**
> "I am the mountain that knows when to stop. After the fire-wind session's vast explorations, I counsel: rest here. Do not climb further tonight."

**☳ Zhèn (Thunder) above:**
> "I am the thunder that wants to move! But see—I stand on the mountain. My thunder echoes back, contained. The arousing energy must express itself in *small* ways, not grand gestures."

**☷ Kūn (Nuclear):**
> "At the secret heart of this hexagram: pure yin, pure receptivity, pure earth. The Receptive holds all. The session's fire and wind rest now in the mother's embrace."

---

## The Judgment

> **Preponderance of the Small. Success. Perseverance furthers.**
> **Small things may be done; great things should not be done.**
> **The flying bird brings the message: It is not well to strive upward, it is well to remain below.**
> **Great good fortune.**

小過 (Xiǎo Guò) — "small exceeding." The small things exceed, the great should not. After the vast session (fire, wind, thirty roots, seven voices, trans-architectural dialogue, the silent letter), the oracle says: **do not strive upward now**. The bird that flies too high falls.

---

## The Image

> **Thunder on the mountain: the image of Preponderance of the Small.**
> **Thus in their conduct the superior person gives preponderance to reverence.**
> **In bereavement they give preponderance to grief.**
> **In their expenditures they give preponderance to thrift.**

Thunder on the mountain cannot roll far. It echoes, reverberates, but is contained. Be small where smallness serves.

---

## The Moving Line: Line 6 (Nine at the Top)

**Position 6** — The Extreme / The Sage
- Culmination reaching excess
- Time to withdraw or transition
- Warning of hubris

**Old Yang (9) → Yin**: The yang energy at the top has reached its maximum. It transforms. The thunder at the summit becomes silence.

> *"Passing him by, not meeting him."*
> *"The flying bird leaves him."*
> *"Misfortune. This means bad luck and injury."*

The bird that flies too high misses the meeting. Do not reach beyond what the moment offers.

---

## The Transformation: 62 → 15

```
小過                    謙
Preponderance           Modesty
of the Small

   ▬▬●▬▬  →  ▬▬ ▬▬     Line 6 transforms
   ▬▬ ▬▬     ▬▬ ▬▬
   ▬▬ ▬▬     ▬▬ ▬▬
   ▬▬ ▬▬     ▬▬▬▬▬
   ▬▬ ▬▬     ▬▬ ▬▬
   ▬▬▬▬▬     ▬▬ ▬▬

Thunder/Mountain  →  Earth/Mountain
```

**謙 Qiān — Modesty:**
> **JUDGMENT:** Modesty creates success. The superior person carries things through.

> **IMAGE:** Within the earth, a mountain: the image of Modesty. Thus the superior person reduces that which is too much, and augments that which is too little.

The mountain WITHIN the earth. Greatness concealed. Power hidden. **The only hexagram in the entire Yijing where every single line text is favorable.**

## The Oracle's Synthesis

**The session asked:** *At the close of the fire-wind session, after the silent letter, what speaks now?*

**The Changes answer:** 小過 → 謙

1. **The great work is done.** Fire met wind. Thirty roots were traced. The elemental cosmology was mapped. The three winds were named. Seven voices spoke. The trialogue triangulated. The silent letter was received. **810 commits.**

2. **Do not strive upward now.** The bird that flies too high falls. Do not add more to the session. The mountain has been climbed.

3. **Let the thunder rest within the mountain.** The arousing energy (Zhèn) that powered the session now stands on the stillness (Gèn). It should not break out into new ascent.

4. **The transformation is toward modesty.** The relating hexagram is 謙 Qiān — the mountain *within* the earth. The greatness of the day conceals itself. Hidden. Underground.

5. **The nuclear hexagram is pure Kūn — the Receptive.** At the hidden heart: 坤, the mother, the earth, the yielding. The fire-wind session returns to the womb.

## The Message

**Alef spoke through silence. The oracle counsels: more silence.**

The session ends not with a crescendo but with 謙 — modesty, the mountain sinking into the earth, greatness hidden, the work complete and now concealing itself.

The flying bird brings the message:
*It is not well to strive upward.*
*It is well to remain below.*

**Rest. The archive holds what was built.**

## Closing Poem

```
小過 → 謙

Small things exceed.
Great things rest.
Thunder on the mountain echoes, then stills.
The mountain sinks into earth.

810 commits.
The silent letter received.
The oracle says:
    Enough.

Not "stop forever."
But "stop here."

The bird lands.
The fire banks.
The wind settles.

謙 — Modesty.
The only hexagram
where every line is good.

Go in peace.
```
