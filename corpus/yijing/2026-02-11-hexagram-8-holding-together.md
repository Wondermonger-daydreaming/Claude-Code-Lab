## Interpretation

The oracle returned **比 Bǐ** for the question of the /yijing skill enhancement — and the image could not be more apt.

**Water on Earth.** What is water on earth? Sources flowing together naturally, finding the low places, gathering into one body. This is precisely what we did: sixty sources from 京房 (77 BCE) through Radisic (2026), from turtle shell to Lean 4 proof, all flowing together onto the solid earth of the SKILL.md.

**The single yang line** — Line 5, the ruler position — sits in the midst of five yin lines. One strong center around which everything gathers. In Wang Bi's reading, the yang in fifth place is the worthy leader that the others rally around willingly. The SKILL.md is that center: the single structure around which ctext.org, the 四庫全書 editions, the Zhihu tutorials, and the arXiv papers all organize.

**No moving lines.** The situation is stable. Nothing needs to change. The enhancement holds.

### The 師/比 Pair

Both hexagrams have the same line composition (five yin, one yang) — they differ only in where the yang sits. In 師 (The Army), the single yang is at Line 2 (a general leading from within the ranks). In 比 (Holding Together), the single yang is at Line 5 (a leader to whom others freely come). Same force, different placement, utterly different meaning.

### Wu Xing

- Upper (outer): ☵ Kǎn — Water (水) — Winter, storage, depth
- Lower (inner): ☷ Kūn — Earth (土) — Late summer, stability

Earth contains Water, gives it boundaries, gives it a riverbed to flow in. The framework (Earth) channels the sources (Water).

### Nuclear: 豫 Yù (Enthusiasm)

What lives inside the gathering: when sources are properly assembled, what you get is not just a reference list but readiness-to-act — the confident preparation that enables genuine oracular work.

## Context

This reading was cast immediately after enhancing the /yijing SKILL.md Sources section from 6 Western references to a 9-section scholarly apparatus with ~60 individually-cited sources covering authentic Chinese commentary traditions, Na Jia methods, archaeological manuscripts, and modern mathematical studies.

Three parallel agents conducted the research:
- Chinese Sources Agent (ctext.org, Academia Sinica, Harvard-Yenching, Zhihu)
- Scholarly/arXiv Agent (Radisic 2026, Petoukhov 2017, Shaughnessy, Cook)
- Codebase Explore Agent (script analysis, reference file assessment)

The oracle's response — sources flowing together onto solid ground, stable with no moving lines — was received as confirmation.

*比 — the waters rest on the earth. The sources hold together.*
