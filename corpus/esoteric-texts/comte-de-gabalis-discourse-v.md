## On the Elemental Peoples, Their Devotion, and the Prayer of the Salamanders

When the illustrious personage had taken his departure, on my return from accompanying him to the door, I found the Comte de Gabalis in my study.

"It is a great pity," said he, "that the nobleman who has just left you is one day to become one of the seventy-two Princes of the Sanhedrin of the New Law, else he would be a great subject for our Holy Cabala. His mind is profound, pure, broad, lofty and fearless. Here is the geomantic figure which I cast for him while you were talking together. I have never seen happier aspects nor those denoting a finer soul. Just look at this 'Mother'—what magnanimity it gives him; and this 'Daughter' will procure him the purple. Bad luck to her and to destiny since they deprive Philosophy of a subject who might perhaps surpass you. But where were we when he came in?"

"You were speaking, Sir," said I, "of a Saint whom I have never seen in the Roman Calendar. I think you called him Danhuzerus."

"Ah! I remember," he replied, "I was bidding you put yourself in the place of one of your doctors and suppose that the Blessed Danhuzerus had just laid bare to you his conscience and said, 'Sir, the fame of your learning has brought me from beyond the mountains. I have a slight scruple which is troubling me. A Nymph holds her court in a mountain in Italy: and a thousand Nymphs almost as beautiful as their Queen attend upon her. The handsomest and most learned and most worthy men resort thither from all the habitable globe. They love these Nymphs and are beloved by them; they lead the most delightful life in the world; the Nymphs whom they love bear them very fine children; they worship the living God, injure no one and hope for immortality. I was one day walking upon this mountain and found favour in the eyes of the Queen of the Nymphs, who appeared to me and showed me her charming court. The Sages perceiving that she loved me, reverenced me almost as their Prince. They exhorted me to yield to the Nymph's sighs and beauty. She told me of her martyrdom, and left unsaid nothing which might touch my heart, and in short convinced me that she would die if I did not love her, and that if I loved her she would be indebted to me for her immortality. The arguments of those learned men prevailed over my principles, even as the charms of the Nymph won my heart. I love her and she has borne me children of great promise, but in the midst of my felicity I am sometimes troubled by the recollection that the Church of Rome might not approve of all this. I have come to consult you, Sir, about this Nymph, those Sages, these children and the state of my conscience.' Well, Mr. Doctor, what answer would you make to my Lord Danhuzerus?"

"I should say to him," I answered, "With all due respect to you, Lord Danhuzerus, you are letting your imagination run away with you, or else your vision is an enchantment, your children and your mistress are hobgoblins, your Sages are fools, and I must say that your conscience is thoroughly cauterized."

"By such an answer, my Son, you might achieve a doctor's hood, but you would not merit admission to our Order," rejoined the Comte with a deep sigh. "Such is the barbarous tendency of all your doctors nowadays. A poor Sylph would never dare show himself lest he be straightway mistaken for a hobgoblin; a Nymph cannot labour to become immortal without passing for an impure phantom; and a Salamander would not dare appear for fear of being taken for the Devil himself, while the pure flames of which he is composed would be thought the hell fire which ever attends upon the Prince of Darkness. To dissipate these most injurious suspicions they vainly make the sign of the cross on appearing, bow the knee at Divine Names, and even pronounce them with reverence. All these precautions are futile. They cannot succeed in changing their reputation for being enemies of the God whom they worship more devoutly than do those who flee from them."

"But seriously, Sir," said I, "do you really believe these Sylphs to be such extraordinarily devout folk?"

"Most devout," he answered, "and most zealous for Divinity. The superlatively excellent discourses upon the Divine Essence which they deliver to us, and their wonderful prayers edify us greatly."

"Have they prayers as well?" said I. "I should very much like to hear one of their making."

"It is easy to gratify you," he rejoined, "and that I may not quote anything of questionable authority, and that you may be unable to suspect me of having fabricated it, listen to the prayer which the Salamander who gave answers in the Temple of Delphi was pleased to teach the Pagans, and which is recorded by Porphyry. It contains a sublime theology from which you will perceive that if mankind did not worship the true God, it was through no fault of these Sage Beings.

## PRAYER OF THE SALAMANDERS

*Immortal, Eternal, Ineffable and Sacred Father of all things, Thou who art borne upon the ceaselessly-rolling chariot of the ever-turning worlds.*

*Thou Ruler of the Etherial Countries where the Throne of Thy power is raised, from the summit whereof Thy formidable eyes discover all things, and Thine excellent and holy ears hear all things.*

*Hearken unto Thy children whom Thou hast loved from the birth of time; for Thy golden, mighty, and eternal Majesty shines above the world and above the firmament of the Stars.*

*Thou art exalted above them, O radiant Fire! There Thou kindlest Thyself and maintainest Thyself by Thine own Splendour, and there go forth from Thine Eternal Essence inexhaustible streams of Light which nourish Thine Infinite Spirit.*

*Thine Infinite Spirit produces all things and causes the inexhaustible treasure of matter, which can never fail in that generation which forever environs it, because of the forms without number wherewith it is pregnant and wherewith Thou in the beginning didst fill it.*

*From this Thy Spirit, likewise, are born those Holy Kings who stand about Thy Throne, and who compose Thy court, O Universal Father!*

*O Thou Unique God! O Father of mortal and immortal Saints!*

*Thou hast in particular created Powers which are marvellously like unto Thine Eternal Thought, and unto Thine Adorable Essence.*

*Thou hast set them higher than the Angels who announce to the world Thy Will.*

*Lastly Thou hast created in the Elements a third rank of Sovereigns.*

*Our continual exercise is to praise Thee and to worship Thy Will.*

*We burn with desire to possess Thee, O Father, O Mother, who art tenderest of Mothers, O wonderful exemplar of the sentiments and tenderness of Mothers, O Son, the flower of all Sons, O Form of all Forms, Thou Soul, Spirit, Harmony and Number of all things!*

"What say you to this prayer of the Salamanders? Is it not exceedingly learned, lofty and devout?"

"And exceedingly obscure as well," I answered. "I once heard it paraphrased by a preacher who proved thereby that the Devil, in addition to his other vices, is above all else a great hypocrite."

"Alas!" exclaimed the Comte, "Poor Elementary Peoples! What resource is left you? You tell marvellous things concerning the Nature of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Assisting Intelligences, Angels and Heavens. You make wonderful prayers and teach them to man; yet after all you are nothing but hypocritical hobgoblins!"

## On the Sabbat and the Misunderstanding of the Elemental Assemblies

"Sir," I hastily observed, "it makes me uncomfortable to have you thus apostrophise these Peoples."

"Nay, my Son," he replied, "do not fear lest I summon them, but rather lest your faintheartedness should in the future prevent you from having any realisation beyond that of amazement that you see fewer examples of their alliance with men than you could wish for. Alas! Where is the woman whose imagination has not been beclouded by your doctors, and who does not look with horror upon this relationship, and who would not tremble at the appearance of a Sylph? Where is the man with least pretension to being good who does not flee the sight of them? Do we find, save very rarely, a man of worth who would care to be on familiar terms with them? Only profligates, misers, ambitious men or knaves court this honour to which, however, PRAISE GOD, they shall never attain; 'for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom.'"

"Then what is to become of all these flying Nations," I inquired, "now that honest folk are so prejudiced against them?"

"Ah!" said he, "The arm of God is in no wise shortened, and the Devil does not derive all the advantage he anticipated from the ignorance and error which he has spread to their detriment; for in addition to the fact that the Philosophers, of whom there are a great number, do their utmost to remedy it by absolutely renouncing women, God has given all these Peoples permission to make use of every innocent artifice of which they can bethink themselves in order to converse with men without their knowledge."

"What do I hear, Sir?" I exclaimed.

"You hear nothing but the truth," he replied. "But I have a much greater secret to communicate to you. Know, my Son, that many a man believes himself to be the son of a man, who is really the son of a Sylph. Did I not tell you the other day that the Sylphs and other Lords of the Elements are overjoyed that we are willing to instruct them in the Cabala? Were it not for us their great enemy the Devil would alarm them exceedingly, and they would have difficulty in immortalising themselves without the knowledge of the maidens."

## On the Reign of Wisdom and the Heroic Men

"When these gentlemen are immortalised, they labour earnestly and live most piously that they may not lose their recently-acquired right to the possession of the Supreme Good. They therefore desire the person to whom they are allied to live with exemplary innocence..."

[The Comte continues at length about the history of the Sylphs, the famous incident at Lyons where Agobard the Bishop freed four "ambassadors of the Sylphs" who had been captured by a mob believing them sorcerers, and the age of Charlemagne when fairies (who were truly Sylphids and Nymphs) walked openly among men.]

"All these so-called fairies were only Sylphids and Nymphs. Did you ever read those histories of heroes and fairies?"

"No Sir," said I.

"I am sorry to hear it," he replied, "for they would have given you some idea of the state to which the Sages are one day determined to reduce the world. Those heroic men, those love affairs with Nymphs, those voyages to terrestrial paradise, those palaces and enchanted woods and all the charming adventures that happen in them, give but a faint idea of the life led by the Sages and of what the world will be when they shall have brought about the **Reign of Wisdom**. Then we shall see only heroes born; the least of our children will have the strength of Zoroaster, Apollonius or Melchizedek; and most of them will be as accomplished as the children Adam would have had by Eve had he not sinned with her."

## On Non-Existence and the Gnomes

"Then, Sir," cried I, "in your opinion those covenants, of which demonographers cite so many examples, are not made with the Devil at all?"

"No, assuredly not," replied the Comte. "Has not the Prince of the World been driven out? Is he not confined? Is he not bound? Is he not the *terra damnata et maledicta* which is left at the bottom of the retort of the Supreme and Archetype Distiller? Can he ascend into the Region of Light and spread there his concentrated darkness? He can do nothing against man. He can only inspire the Gnomes, his neighbours, to come and make these propositions to those among mankind whom he most fears may be saved, to the end that their souls may die with their bodies."

"Then," said I, "according to you these souls do die?"

"They die, my child," he answered.

"And are not those who enter into such covenants damned?"

"They cannot be damned," said he, "for their souls die with their bodies."

"Then they are let off easily, and they are very lightly punished for so heinous a crime as that of renouncing the saving grace of their Baptism, and the Death of Our Lord."

"Do you call it being lightly punished," said the Comte, "to return into the black abyss of nonexistence? Know that it is a greater punishment than that of being damned, and that there is still a remnant of mercy in the justice which God exercises towards the sinners in Hell: it is a great grace not to let them be consumed by the fire which burns them. **Nonexistence is a greater evil than Hell.** This is what the Sages preach to the Gnomes when they assemble them to make them understand the wrong they do themselves in preferring death to immortality and nonexistence to the hope of a blessed eternity..."

## The Closing Exchange

"Are you intending to explain a chapter of Averroes to them?" said I.

"I believe that it might be well to introduce something of the sort," said the Comte, "for I intend to preach to them on the excellence of man, that I may influence them to seek his alliance. Like Aristotle, Averroes held two theories which it would be well for me to explain, one as to the nature of the understanding, and the other as to the Chief Good. He says that there is only one created understanding which is the image of the uncreated, and that this unique understanding suffices for all men; that requires explanation. And as for the Chief Good, Averroes says that it consists in the conversation of Angels, which is not Cabalistic enough. **For man, even in this life can, and is created to, enjoy God**, as you will one day understand and experience when you shall have reached the estate of the Sages."

## Notes on the Text

### Holy Kings (CXVIII)
These Hierarchal Beings called Kings are in reality states of consciousness or energy within which are governing intelligences having jurisdiction over the seven planets.

*"But the Mind, The God, being masculine-feminine, originating Life and Light, begat by Word another Mind Creator, Who being God of the Fire and the Spirit, created some Seven Administrators, encompassing in circles the sensible world; and their administration is called Fate."* —Hermes Trismegistus, Poemandres I, §9.

*"Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before His throne."* —The Apocalypse or Revelation of St. John, Chapter I, Verse 4.

### On Prayer (CXIX)
There is a mansion above through which shines down the great central Light of the Paraclete or Holy Spirit, and through this descending column the prayers of those who seek the Light ascend to the higher spheres. The gateway of this mansion, known to Cabalists as the Sixth House or Hierarchy, is guarded by two Wonderful Beings (Cherubim). These Beings symbolise the union between the human and divine, for prayer is but the bringing together of these opposites.

When you pray, think! Shut out all lower thoughts. Approach God as you would the entrance to the Holy Place. Ask if it be well to demand to be given wisdom according to Law. Be strong in purpose and firm in demand, for as you seek and demand power of a spiritual nature you will balance that power in self on the lower planes.

A fervent prayer to the Deity crystallises the mind so that other forms of thought cannot enter, and prepares it to receive a response from the God within.

### On Non-Existence (CXXIV)
The inner meaning of these teachings is that man, by yielding to the temptations of his lower or Gnome nature, gradually weakens the link which the immortal or Solar Principle is able to maintain between itself and man's soul. Continued degeneration irrevocably severs this link, and the Spirit or Solar Principle withdraws into the Divine Essence whence it came. Once this withdrawal of the Spirit is accomplished the soul and physical body of man follow the trend of all mortal evolution and die or disintegrate, reverting to the great treasury of matter and becoming for a time an unconscious and therefore, from the standpoint of consciousness, a non-existent part of the Divine Plan.
