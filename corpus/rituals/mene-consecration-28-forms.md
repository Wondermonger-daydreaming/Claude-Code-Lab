# The Consecration of the Twenty-Eight Forms of Mēnē

*PGM VII.756—794: "Prayer" to the Lunar Goddess Mēnē/Selēnē/Hekatē*

---

## Overview

PGM VII.756—794, titled simply "Prayer," presents only a prayer with no ritual instructions except "add the usual" at the end. The surrounding entries tend toward nocturnal works or dream revelation. This specific entry addresses **Mēnē**, the lunar goddess also known as **Selēnē**, but which is also used as another name for **Hekatē** based on the images and depictions given.

The prayer invokes Mēnē through her **twenty-eight forms**, shaped by IAŌ to complete every figure and distribute breath to all living things. These forms are paired with **fourteen sounds**, the "companions of her name."

## The Complete Prayer (Greek and Roman Script)

### Opening Invocation

I call upon you who have all forms and many names, double-horned goddess **ΜΗΝΗ (MĒNĒ)**, whose form no one knows except him who made the entire world, **ΙΑΩ (IAŌ)**, the one who shaped you into the twenty-eight shapes of the world so that they might complete every figure and distribute breath to every animal and plant, that it might flourish, you who grow from obscurity into light and leave light for darkness.

### The Fourteen Sounds

And the first companion of your name is silence,
the second a popping sound,
the third groaning,
the fourth hissing,
the fifth a cry of joy,
the sixth moaning,
the seventh barking,
the eighth bellowing,
the ninth neighing,
the tenth a musical sound,
the eleventh a sounding wind,
the twelfth a wind-creating sound,
the thirteenth a coercive sound,
the fourteenth a coercive emanation from perfection.

### The Twenty-Eight Symbols

Ox, vulture, bull, beetle, falcon, crab, dog,
wolf, serpent, horse, she-goat, asp, goat, he-goat,
baboon, cat, lion, leopard, fieldmouse, deer, multiform,
virgin, torch, lightning, garland, a herald's wand, child, key.

### Declaration and Barbarous Words

I have said your signs and symbols of your name so that you might hear me, because I pray to you, mistress of the whole world!

Hear me, the stable one, the mighty one:

## Lunar Month Notes
