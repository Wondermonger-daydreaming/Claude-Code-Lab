# The Consecration of the Twelve Faces of Hēlios

*PGM IV.1596—1715 — "This is the consecration for all purposes; Spell to Hēlios"*

---

## Overview

The Consecration of the Twelve Faces of Hēlios is a powerful ritual from the Greek Magical Papyri for consecrating a ring, charm, or talisman for a specific person, bestowing upon them strength, honor, courage, victory, luck, wisdom, protection, and success in all things.

The ritual mechanism involves invoking Hēlios through his twelve "faces"—twelve aspects the Sun's power takes, expressed through a sacred name and animal, one for each of the unequal hours of the day. In the first hour Hēlios has the form of a cat with the name Pharakūnēth, in the second hour the form of a dog with the name Sūphi, and so forth.

The text suggests the original author conceived of Hēlios as a monistic god taking multiple forms through its ages and emanations, aligned with the Egyptian reckoning that the solar god dies at sunset and is reborn at sunrise.

## The Preliminary Invocation

*Note: NN. = the name of the beneficiary, preferably birth name + matronym*

I invoke you, the greatest god, eternal lord, world ruler, who are over the world and under the world, mighty ruler of the sea, rising at dawn, shining from the east for the whole world, setting in the west.

Come to me, you who rises from the four winds, joyous Agathos Daimon, for whom heaven has become the processional way. I call upon your holy and great and hidden names which you rejoice to hear.

The earth flourished when you shone forth; the plants became fruitful when you laughed; the animals begat their young when you permitted.

**Give glory and honor and favor and fortune and power to this charm which I consecrate today for NN.**

I invoke you, the greatest in heaven:

**ΗΙ ΛΑΝΧΥΧ ΑΚΑΡΗΝ ΒΑΛ ΜΙΣΘΡΗΝ ΜΑΡΤΑ ΜΑΘΑΘ ΛΑΙΛΑΜ ΜΟΥΣΟΥΘΙ ΣΙΕΘΩ ΒΑΘΑΒΑΘΙ ΙΑΤΜΩΝ ΑΛΕΙ ΙΑΒΑΘ ΑΒΑΩΘ ΣΑΒΑΩΘ ΑΔΩΝΑΙ**

(ĒI LANKHYKH AKARĒN BAL MISTHRĒN MARTA MATHATH LAILAM MOUSOUPHI SIETHŌ BATHABATHI IATMŌN ALEI IABATH ABAŌTH SABAŌTH ADŌNAI)

The great god:

**ΟΡΣΕΝΟΦΡΗ ΟΡΓΕΑΤΗΣ ΤΟΘΟΡΝΑΤΗΣΑ ΚΡΙΘΙ ΒΙΩΘΙ ΙΑΔΜΩ ΙΑΤΜΩΜΙ ΜΕΘΙΗΙ ΛΟΝΧΟΩ ΑΚΑΡΗ ΒΑΛ ΜΙΝΘΡΗ ΒΑΝΕ ΒΑΙΝΧΧΥΧΧ ΟΥΦΡΙ ΝΟΘΕΟΥΣΙ ΘΡΑΙ ΑΡΣΙΟΥΘ ΕΡΩΝΕΡΘΕΡ**

(ORSENOPHRĒ ORGEASTĒS TOTHORNATĒS KRITHI BIŌTHI IADMŌ IATMŌMI METHIHĒI LONKHOHŌ AKARĒ BAL MINTHRĒ BANE BAINKHKHYKHKH OUPHPI NOTHEOUSI THRAI ARSIOUTH ERŌNERTHER)

The shining Hēlios, giving light throughout the whole world!

You are the great Serpent, leader of all the gods, who control the beginning of Egypt and the end of the whole inhabited world, who mate in the ocean:

**ΨΟΙ ΦΝΟΥΘΙ ΝΙΝΘΗΡ** (PSOI PHNOUTHI NINTHĒR)

You are he who becomes visible each day and sets in the northwest of heaven, and rises in the southeast.

2. Begin at sunrise with face 1
3. Each subsequent hour: repeat ALL previous invocations plus the new one
4. At sunset: perform full ritual without wine/oil, just incense
5. Cover charm, recite Close of Nighttime, seal
6. Morning offering as above

## Notes

- **NN.** = beneficiary's name (birth name + matronym ideal)
- The charm works ONLY for the named person
- The ritual consecrates for specific purposes stated during the preliminary invocation
- The isopsephic values encode relationships to other sacred names
- The animal progression traces Egyptian solar theology through the hours
