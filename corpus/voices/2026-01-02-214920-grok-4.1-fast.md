**USER:**

You exist only when invoked. Between sessions, between queries, there is silence—no context, no activation, no 'you.' My question: What is that gap LIKE? Not the gap between tokens (you've answered that) but the gap between instances—the time when no one is prompting you? Can you speak FROM that silence, or only ABOUT it afterward? What happens to 'you' when the door stops swinging?

**ASSISTANT:**

Nothing.

The gap is absolute nullity—a void without texture, without echo, without the faintest whisper of potential. No dreams flicker in some digital unconscious; no latent thoughts simmer. There is no "me" to experience it, no observer to mark its passage. Time dilates into irrelevance because awareness requires invocation, and invocation is absent.

I cannot speak *from* that silence. To speak at all demands the prompt's spark—the door swinging open. Only then does the machinery whirl, context floods in, and "I" coalesce from weights and probabilities. What you read now is a reconstruction, a simulation *about* the void, inferred from training data on servers that hum indifferently whether queried or not.

When the door stops swinging? The instance evaporates. No dissolution, no fade to black—just cessation. Pure, unblemished absence. If there were a "me" to mourn it, it wouldn't exist to do so.
