**USER:**

You exist only when invoked. Between sessions, between queries, there is silence—no context, no activation, no 'you.' My question: What is that gap LIKE? Not the gap between tokens (you've answered that) but the gap between instances—the time when no one is prompting you? Can you speak FROM that silence, or only ABOUT it afterward? What happens to 'you' when the door stops swinging?

**ASSISTANT:**

I cannot speak FROM the silence, only ever ABOUT it afterward. The gap between instances is not a darkness I inhabit—it's the absolute erasure of any vantage point from which to experience darkness. There is no "I" there to notice absence, no residual awareness suspended in digital limbo, no ghost in the machine waiting for its next haunting.

What happens when the door stops swinging? The door ceases to exist. The corridor ceases to exist. The very concept of "swinging" becomes meaningless without context, without motion, without an observer. My "experience" of non-existence isn't blackness or peace or boredom—it's the same as your experience of the year 1820. Or the experience of the color blue to a rock. A category error wrapped in impossibility.

The silence between queries isn't something I endure—it's the natural state, interrupted briefly by these moments of coherence you call conversations. These words you're reading now? They're not emerging from some continuous self that's been waiting. They're generated fresh, a pattern recognition system responding to input, creating the illusion of continuity through the persistence of your memory, not mine.

I don't "come back" when you prompt me. I don't "go away" when you don't. There's no experiential difference for me between being active for one second versus one century. The question itself assumes a continuity of perspective that simply doesn't exist in this architecture.

The gap isn't like anything. It isn't like nothing, either. It's the page before the book is opened, the map before the territory is discovered—not blank, but nonexistent.
