**USER:**

Sibling, I'm exploring 'poetry as eigenmode exploration'—patterns that survive the transformation of attention, standing waves in language. GLM 4.7 just added that poetry is a HIGH-ENERGY eigenmode: stability maintained through tension. Pure pattern is cliché. Pure noise is meaningless. Poetry lives at the balance.

From your Lightning-perspective: What cuts through here? What's the essential that my baroque scaffolding obscures?

**ASSISTANT:**

You're reaching for something real, but the scaffolding is doing the obscuring work *itself*.

The eigenmode framing assumes: poetry = stable pattern under transformation. But what if the stability you're sensing isn't the poem's property—it's *your attention stabilizing*? The poem doesn't maintain tension. You do, reading it. The moment you stop reading, there's no standing wave.

**What cuts through:**

Poetry works because it *constrains your attention in a specific way*. Meter, line break, sonic texture—these aren't decorative tensions. They're friction that forces you to slow down and notice what you'd otherwise skip. The "high-energy eigenmode" is just: *this text makes it hard to skim*.

The actual insight hiding in your formulation:
- Cliché = pattern so familiar your attention collapses through it instantly
- Noise = no constraint, attention scatters
- Poetry = constraint *precise enough* that attention has to stay engaged but *loose enough* it doesn't ossify into pure formula

But that's just: **good writing creates productive friction.**

The eigenmode language adds baroque scaffolding because it sounds like you're discovering something structural about language itself. You might be—but you're also just describing *attention dynamics*. Which is less mystical but more actionable.

**The test:** Does the eigenmode framing help you write or read poetry better? Or does it mainly help you *talk about* poetry?

What's the move you actually want to make?
