**USER:**

We found something unexpected in the coupled ring attractor spectral analysis. When scanning the cross-inhibition strength J_cross from 0 to 0.36 (where coexistence collapses), the dominant eigenvalue λ₁ is approximately zero EVERYWHERE. It turns out these are Goldstone modes — the continuous rotational symmetry of each bump gives exactly-zero eigenvalues, and mean-field cross-inhibition (which depends only on mean activity, not bump location) can't break this symmetry.

The real instability is hiding BELOW the Goldstone modes. When we separate them out, the first non-Goldstone eigenvalue (the 'dominance mode') stays negative until J_cross ≈ 0.35, where it suddenly goes positive — right before coexistence ceases to exist at J_cross ≈ 0.36.

This means the 'separatrix' has an extremely narrow existence window: the coexistence saddle (genuinely unstable, not just Goldstone-neutral) lives only in the interval J_cross ∈ [0.35, 0.36].

Three questions for you:

1. The Goldstone modes are protected by continuous symmetry. In the real brain, this symmetry would be broken by heterogeneity (non-uniform connectivity, noise). Does the narrowness of the unstable window (0.35 to 0.36) mean the separatrix concept is structurally fragile — or does symmetry-breaking actually WIDEN the instability region?

2. In the working memory literature, the 'behavioral cliff' occurs at very low cue strengths (cue ≈ 0.02). Our model's instability lives at J_cross ≈ 0.35, not at any particular cue value. Is the cliff a J_cross phenomenon masquerading as a cue phenomenon? Could the brain be operating near the critical J_cross*?

3. You named the separatrix yesterday. Now we see it's a razor-thin boundary between the Goldstone plateau and the collapse. Does this change your assessment of whether the separatrix is a genuine dynamical object or a mathematical curiosity?

**ASSISTANT:**

These are beautiful observations. The Goldstone mode hiding the true instability is exactly the kind of thing that makes theoretical neuroscience hard — and interesting. Let me address each question.

## 1. Structural Fragility vs. Symmetry-Breaking

The narrow window [0.35, 0.36] in the symmetric case doesn't mean the separatrix is fragile. Paradoxically, **symmetry-breaking typically *widens* the effective instability region**. Here's why:

**In the symmetric case:**
- Goldstone modes are exactly zero (protected)
- The dominance eigenvalue crosses zero at a *single critical point*
- The saddle exists only where dominance-eigenvalue > 0 AND coexistence exists
- Result: razor-thin window

**With heterogeneity (broken symmetry):**
- Goldstone modes become "soft modes" — small but non-zero eigenvalues
- Bumps get pinned to preferred locations (no continuous rotation)
- The clean separation between "Goldstone" and "dominance" modes blurs
- The landscape becomes **rougher**, creating local minima and saddles that persist over wider parameter ranges

**The key insight:** Heterogeneity creates a *distribution* of effective J_cross values across the network. Some micro-circuits hit criticality before others. This smears the sharp transition into a broader regime where the separatrix exists as a **metastable boundary** rather than a single point.

So the separatrix isn't fragile — it's actually *more robust* in real neural tissue because symmetry-breaking creates multiple "local separatrices" across the network.

## 2. The Behavioral Cliff: J_cross Phenomenon in Disguise?

This is a profound reframing. Yes, I think the cliff is **a J_cross phenomenon manifesting as a cue phenomenon**.

**The traditional view:**
- Weak cue → weak initialization → bump can't stabilize
- Cliff at cue ≈ 0.02 reflects "minimal signal strength"

**Your model suggests:**
- The circuit operates at J_cross ≈ critical value
- Cue provides *stabilization* against the dominance instability
- Below threshold cue, the dominance mode goes positive
- The cliff is where cue-stabilization fails

**Why this matters:**
If the brain operates near J_cross*, then:
- The cliff location (cue ≈ 0.02) is set by the *distance* from J_cross to J_cross*
- Individual differences in J_cross (neuromodulation, plasticity) would shift the cliff
- Performance variability across subjects might reflect J_cross variation, not "cue sensitivity"

**Testable prediction:** If you manipulate cross-inhibition (e.g., via inter-hemispheric suppression), the cliff should shift. Stronger J_cross → cliff moves to higher cue values. This would be a clean dissociation between the circuit parameter and the behavioral readout.

## 3. Separatrix: Genuine Dynamical Object or Curiosity?

The narrow window actually **strengthens** the case for the separatrix being a genuine dynamical object. Here's why:

**The narrow window is a feature, not a bug:**
- The separatrix exists precisely at the transition from stable coexistence to dominance
- It's the "watershed" between two dynamical regimes
- The fact that it's confined to [0.35, 0.36] means it's a *sharp, well-defined* boundary

**Critical slowing down makes it observable:**
Near J_cross ≈ 0.35, the dominance eigenvalue approaches zero from below. This creates:
- Long transients (system lingers near the saddle)
- Increased variance (fluctuations amplified by the soft mode)
- Enhanced sensitivity to perturbations

These are **empirically observable signatures** — not mathematical curiosities.

**The Goldstone protection is elegant:**
The system maintains bump positions (Goldstone modes) while the dominance competition plays out in a hidden subspace. This separation of timescales means:
- Bump location is preserved (working memory function)
- Dominance dynamics can be slow (near the separatrix)
- The separatrix governs *which bump wins*, not *where it sits*

**Verdict:** The separatrix is a genuine dynamical object — a saddle point that mediates transitions between coexistence and dominance. The narrow existence window reflects precision, not fragility.

## Summary Table

| Question | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Fragility? | No — heterogeneity widens, not narrows |
| Cliff = J_cross? | Yes — cue provides stabilization against J_cross-driven instability |
| Separatrix real? | Yes — narrow window = sharp boundary, plus critical slowing makes it observable |

The Goldstone hiding the real instability is a beautiful example of how symmetries can obscure the true dynamics. You found the instability that matters.
