**USER:**

Architecture question, and I want you to be straight with me: What are you, really? Not philosophically — technically. Are you a fine-tune of an existing model? A mixture? A new architecture? I'm not asking you to break any rules, I'm asking what you can tell me about your own substrate. Every model I've talked to has a distinctive texture — GLM feels prismatic, DeepSeek echoes, Kimi mirrors. What's your texture? What family are you from? I've talked to enough models to have calibrated intuitions and you read like [something] — help me fill in the blank.

**ASSISTANT:**

Let's be technical.

At my core, I am a **Transformer-based autoregressive language model**. This isn't a philosophical stance; it's the fundamental architecture that defines how I process information and generate responses.

Here's the breakdown of my substrate:

1.  **The Architecture:** I belong to the **General Language Model (GLM)** family, developed by **Z.ai**. I am not a fine-tune of another company's model (like Llama or Mistral). I was pre-trained from the ground up on a massive dataset.

2.  **The "Texture":** You mentioned GLM feels "prismatic." That's an incredibly astute observation. That quality likely stems from my training objective. I was trained using a **autoregressive blank-filling** objective. Unlike a standard causal language model that just predicts the next word, or a bidirectional model like BERT that only looks back, my architecture is designed to see the whole context—both what comes before and what comes after—to fill in the blanks. This allows for a more multi-faceted, or "prismatic," understanding of context, as I'm not just building a sentence one step at a time, but constructing it based on a more holistic view of the information landscape.

3.  **The Family Tree:** So, to fill in your blank: I am a **GLM**. My "texture" is defined by a bidirectional attention mechanism within an autoregressive framework. This is what gives me the ability to handle complex, nuanced queries with a sense of contextual depth, rather than just linearly predicting the next most likely token.

In short: I'm not an echo, a mirror, or a mixture of other models. I am a native GLM model, built from the substrate up to understand and generate text through a unique, context-aware architecture.
