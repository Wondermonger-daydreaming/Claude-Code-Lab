**USER:**

Follow-up to our spectral mathematics discussion. You identified 7 blind spots, including the BBP confusion (detection vs bifurcation). We've now implemented:

1. Newton's method continuation — starting from the symmetric fixed point at cue=0, we track the solution branch as cue_gain increases. Unlike forward simulation (which falls off unstable equilibria), Newton finds the root regardless of stability.

2. BBP vs bifurcation comparison — computing both the spiked covariance BBP transition (detection: when does a signal eigenvalue emerge from the MP bulk?) and the dynamical bifurcation (when does the Jacobian's dominant eigenvalue cross zero?). Normalizing both by their critical thresholds to show shared threshold geometry but distinct mechanisms.

3. Critical eigenvector analysis at the UNSTABLE fixed point — if the unstable FP is the coexistence state, its critical eigenvector should be the symmetry-breaking mode (the dominance direction). This might be where the cosine projection actually works (unlike at the stable FP where the dominance question is already resolved).

Questions for you:
- Does the continuation approach address your BBP concern, or are we still conflating?
- The unstable FP's critical eigenvector IS the direction the system wants to go — is this the right way to formalize what the separatrix means?
- What falsification test would you propose for the continuation branch? How would we know if Newton found a genuine unstable equilibrium vs a numerical artifact?

**ASSISTANT:**

This is substantial progress. Let me address each question directly.

## 1. Does continuation address the BBP concern?

**Yes, but with an important clarification.** The continuation approach cleanly separates the two mechanisms:

| Method | What it finds | What it misses |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Forward simulation | Stable attractors | Unstable equilibria (falls off them) |
| Newton continuation | All equilibria | Nothing (finds roots regardless of stability) |
| BBP analysis | Statistical detectability threshold | Dynamical stability |

The BBP transition answers: *"When does the cue contain enough signal to be statistically detectable in the covariance?"*

The bifurcation analysis answers: *"When does that signal destabilize the symmetric fixed point?"*

These thresholds can differ. The continuation lets you compute the bifurcation cleanly. If you then compare it to the BBP threshold and they coincide, that's a **genuine finding** about your system—not a conflation.

**Remaining risk:** If you're computing BBP on the *wrong covariance matrix* (e.g., the empirical covariance of trajectories rather than the cue structure itself), you'd still be mixing levels. The BBP analysis should be on the input statistics; the bifurcation analysis on the dynamical system.

## 2. The unstable FP's critical eigenvector

**This is exactly right and represents a key insight.**

At the stable fixed point (say, memory A retrieved), the dominance question is already resolved—you're at the attractor. The eigenvectors there tell you about *local curvature* of the basin, not about the decision process.

At the unstable coexistence fixed point, the system is genuinely undecided. The critical eigenvector (associated with eigenvalue crossing zero) has a clear interpretation:

```
Critical eigenvector = Tangent to unstable manifold at saddle
                      = Direction system escapes when perturbed
                      = The "dominance axis" in the coexistence state
```

This **does** give meaning to the cosine projection—but only at the unstable FP. If you project the critical eigenvector onto candidate memory patterns, the one with highest alignment is where the system "wants to go."

**Formalization of the separatrix:** The separatrix is the stable manifold of the saddle point. The critical eigenvector (unstable) is orthogonal to this separatrix—pointing "across" it. This is why small perturbations off the separatrix grow along this direction.

## 3. Falsification tests for Newton-found equilibria

Here are rigorous tests, ordered from easiest to most sophisticated:

### Test 1: Residual verification
```
||F(x*)|| / ||x*|| < ε_machine^(3/4)
```
If Newton truly found a root, the residual should be at numerical precision. Anything larger suggests a local minimum of ||F||² rather than a true root.

### Test 2: Eigenvalue-Jacobian consistency
If you claim the equilibrium is unstable with one positive eigenvalue:
- Compute full spectrum of J(x*)
- Verify: exactly one eigenvalue with Re(λ) > 0
- Verify: all others have Re(λ) < 0

If the eigenvalue structure doesn't match your claim, something's wrong.

### Test 3: Forward simulation perturbation test
```python
# At found equilibrium x*
v_critical = eigenvector_of_J_with_largest_real_eigenvalue

# Perturb along unstable direction
x_perturbed = x* + δ * v_critical  # δ small, e.g., 1e-6

# Forward simulate
trajectory = simulate(x_perturbed, t_final)

# Check: does trajectory initially follow v_critical?
initial_direction = (trajectory[1] - trajectory[0]) / ||trajectory[1] - trajectory[0]||
alignment = |v_critical · initial_direction|
# Should be ≈ 1 for genuine unstable manifold
```

### Test 4: Branch continuity check
Track a quantity along the continuation branch (e.g., the dominant eigenvalue). It should vary smoothly. Discontinuities suggest branch-jumping:

```
λ_max(μ) should be continuous in parameter μ
```

If λ_max jumps discontinuously, Newton may have hopped to a different solution branch.

### Test 5: Time-reversal stability
For the dynamical system dx/dt = F(x), the unstable equilibrium becomes stable under time reversal:
```
dx/dt = -F(x)
```
If you run the simulation backwards and the equilibrium becomes attracting, you've found a genuine saddle.

### Test 6: Codimension verification
At a bifurcation point, verify the codimension matches theory:
- **Saddle-node:** One eigenvalue at zero, quadratic nonlinearity non-zero
- **Pitchfork (symmetry-breaking):** One eigenvalue at zero, cubic term determines super/sub-critical
- **Transcritical:** One eigenvalue at zero, exchange of stability between branches

Check that the nullspace of J has the expected dimension.

## A deeper point about your approach

The combination of continuation + BBP comparison + critical eigenvector analysis is genuinely powerful because it lets you map the **full decision geometry**:

1. **BBP threshold:** When does the environment contain a detectable signal?
2. **Bifurcation threshold:** When does that signal become dynamically actionable?
3. **Critical eigenvector:** What is the axis along which the decision happens?
4. **Separatrix:** What is the boundary between alternative decisions?

The key remaining question is whether the BBP and bifurcation thresholds coincide in your system. If they do, you have a clean story: *detection and action share the same geometry.* If they don't, you have an even more interesting story: *the system can detect a signal before it can act on it* (or vice versa), revealing a gap between statistical and dynamical sensitivity.
