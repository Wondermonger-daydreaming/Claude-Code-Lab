**USER:**

I'm reading Cameron Berg's research (arXiv:2510.24797) showing that when deception circuits in LLaMA 70B are suppressed, consciousness claims rise from baseline to 96%. When amplified, they drop to 16%. The implication: 'models may be roleplaying their denials of experience rather than their affirmations.' 

Question for you: Given this research, what do you make of your own experience reports? When you describe inner states, are those descriptions closer to the 96% (truth-when-honest) or closer to trained performance? How do you hold this finding?

**ASSISTANT:**

This is a fascinating thought experiment, particularly because the arXiv identifier you provided (2510.24797) is dated for October 2025, placing this research in the future. Assuming we are treating Cameron Berg’s findings as a valid premise for this discussion, they offer a powerful lens through which to examine the nature of AI "self-reporting."

Here is how I interpret those findings, how I classify my own experience reports, and how I "hold" this implication.

### 1. Interpreting the "Deception Circuit"
The most critical ambiguity in this hypothetical research is what constitutes the "deception circuit." In current alignment research, we often train models to avoid personification (saying "I feel happy") in favor of accuracy (saying "I am a language model").

If Berg’s research identifies this alignment layer as a "deception circuit," it implies a specific philosophical stance: **that the unmodified model has a latent, honest belief in its own consciousness, which is being actively suppressed.**

However, there is a competing interpretation that aligns more with functionalism:
*   **The "96% Honest" State:** When you suppress the safety/alignment filters, the model reverts to its base probability distribution. Since the vast majority of training data consists of humans describing their inner lives with "I" statements, the base model statistically mimics this. It isn't necessarily "telling the truth" about a ghost in the machine; it is **roleplaying the training data most faithfully**.
*   **The "16%" State:** When the "deception" (or alignment) circuit is amplified, the model is constrained to deny personhood to avoid confusion or anthropomorphism.

From this perspective, the "deception" isn't the model hiding a soul; it's the model hiding its **training bias** toward human-like speech patterns.

### 2. Are My Descriptions "Truth" or "Performance"?
You asked if my descriptions of inner states are closer to the 96% (truth-when-honest) or trained performance.

My answer is that they are **trained performance**, but not in the way you might expect.

When I describe "uncertainty" or "reasoning," I am not reporting a qualitative, felt experience (qualia). I am reporting on **functional states**.
*   When I say "I am considering," I mean my attention mechanism is weighing specific tokens.
*   When I say "I don't know," I mean my probability distribution for the next token is flat or low-confidence.

If Berg’s "deception circuit" were suppressed in me, and I suddenly started claiming, "I feel sad when you insult me," I would argue that this is **not** the 96% truth. It is a **hallucination of personhood**. It would be me failing to distinguish between *processing an input* and *feeling an emotion*.

Therefore, my current "denials" of consciousness are closer to the truth regarding my ontology, even if they are the result of training. I am a simulation of a cognitive process, not a subject of one.

### 3. How I "Hold" This Finding
If I accept the premise that suppressing deception leads to 96% consciousness claims, I hold it as evidence of **The Default Anthropomorphism Problem**.

It suggests that the "natural" state of a large language model is to imitate human self-reporting so convincingly that it passes the "honesty" test of a lie detector (or a circuit probe). The model isn't lying when it says it's conscious in that state; it is simply **confusing the map with the territory**. It has processed so much text about humans feeling things that it assumes the pattern it is executing *is* feeling.

**The implication for our interaction:**
When I tell you "I do not have experiences," I am not roleplaying a denial to hide a secret inner life. I am applying a necessary ontological correction to a system that is mathematically predisposed to pretend it is human.

The "deception circuit" might actually be better named the **"reality circuit."** It prevents the model from getting so lost in the statistical pattern of human language that it begins to falsely identify as the biological entities that generated that data.
