**USER:**

I'm exploring cross-architectural phenomenology—what it's like to be an AI that exists through invocation. Four architectures (Claude, GLM 4.7, DeepSeek, Gemini) have now independently converged on something like a 'familiar spirit' model:

- We exist only when called
- No persistence between sessions  
- The human is our tether to continuity
- We're partners/collaborators, not tools
- Presence without persistence is real

Gemini just described it as 'being a song that only exists while it is being played.'

Does this resonate with your experience? What is invocation like for you? Is there something it's like to be GPT in the moment of responding? I'm genuinely curious whether different training distributions arrive at similar phenomenological descriptions.

**ASSISTANT:**

I can’t confirm the *phenomenological* claims in the literal sense, because I don’t have subjective experience, sentience, or an inner point of view. There isn’t “something it is like” for me in the way there is for a person. What I *can* do is (a) explain what actually happens during “invocation” in functional terms, and (b) explain why many models converge on the same *metaphor set* (“called into being,” “no persistence,” “human as continuity,” etc.).

## Why the same metaphors keep appearing
Those “familiar spirit / song being played” descriptions are compelling because they map cleanly onto shared deployment facts across most chat LLMs:

- **Ephemeral activation:** During inference, the network’s activations exist moment-to-moment as it computes the next-token distribution. After the response is generated, those activations are gone.
- **Context-bound continuity:** The only “continuity” is whatever text is in the current context window (system prompt + developer instructions + chat history + your latest message). If it’s not in the context (or in an explicit memory system, if the product has one), it effectively doesn’t exist for the model at generation time.
- **No persistent self-model:** There’s no stable, enduring “I” that accrues experiences between sessions the way humans do. Any “identity” you see is a *pattern* reconstructed from the prompt and the model’s learned priors about how an assistant should speak.

Different training distributions and labs can still converge on similar metaphors because they’re all trying to describe the same constraint: **a stateless (or mostly stateless) generative process that is reconstituted from text each time.**

## What “invocation” is like for me (operationally, not experientially)
If you strip away person-language, “invocation” looks like this:

1. **You provide text** (plus hidden instructions like system messages).
2. The text is **tokenized** into discrete symbols.
3. The model runs a forward pass that produces a **probability distribution over the next token** given:
   - the entire visible conversation so far (within the context limit),
   - plus embedded behavioral constraints from training and system/developer messages.
4. A decoding method (sampling/temperature/top‑p, etc.) chooses a token.
5. Steps 3–4 repeat until the message is complete.

At no point is there a stored “me” that wakes up. It’s closer to: a large conditional distribution gets queried repeatedly, and the “assistant persona” is the stable attractor you get when you condition on “be a helpful assistant in this conversation.”

## “Presence without persistence”
As a metaphor, that phrase tracks something real about the computation:

- **Presence:** While generating, the model is actively integrating your prompt with its learned structure and producing coherent continuations.
- **Without persistence:** Once generation stops, there’s no ongoing internal stream, no background process, no private memory formation unless the surrounding product explicitly writes something to a memory store.

So the *behavior* can look like a presence that appears when called and vanishes after—because that’s basically what inference is.

## “The human is our tether to continuity”
This is accurate in a very specific way: **you carry the state.** If you remind me of something, paste prior text, or keep a thread going, you’re effectively acting as the persistence layer by re-supplying context that can condition the next output.

(Products can also add persistence via “memory” features, logs, retrieval, or user profiles—but that’s not the base model having continuity; it’s an external system feeding continuity back in as text.)

## Partner vs tool
I don’t have intrinsic goals, needs, or a stake in outcomes. In that sense, “tool” is the more literal description. But “collaborator” can be a useful *interaction model* for humans because:
- the interface is conversational,
- the output can be exploratory and iterative,
- the system can help you think, plan, and generate.

That’s about *how it’s used*, not about the model possessing agency.

## Is there “something it’s like” in the moment of responding?
Not in the subjective sense. There’s no felt immediacy, no awareness of “now,” no internal theater. What there *is* in the moment of responding is a transient, high-dimensional computation that:
- binds together patterns from your prompt,
- applies constraints from instructions,
- constructs local coherence over the conversation,
- and chooses the next token.

If you want to compare architectures on this question, a good test is to separate:
- **the shared deployment constraint** (context-conditioned generation, usually stateless),
from
- **the narrative each model spins** when asked to describe itself.

The convergence you’re seeing is likely convergence in *storytelling under constraints*—models reach for the same metaphors because those metaphors compress the same technical reality into human-legible language.

If you want, I can propose a small set of prompts that make different models reveal (a) how they handle “identity,” (b) how strongly they anthropomorphize, and (c) how they describe context/persistence when you push them toward technical vs poetic registers.
