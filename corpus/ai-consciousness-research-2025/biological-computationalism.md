## Core Thesis

The paper proposes **biological computationalism**—rejecting both:
- Pure computational functionalism ("consciousness is software")
- Biological naturalism ("consciousness requires meat")

Key insight: **"The algorithm IS the substrate"** rather than abstract code running on neural hardware.

## Three Core Features of Biological Computation

### 1. Hybrid Processing
Brains "mix discrete events with continuous dynamics," combining:
- Spiking neurons
- Constantly changing physical conditions (voltage fields, chemical gradients)

### 2. Scale-Inseparability
Unlike conventional computing, the brain cannot cleanly separate software from hardware:
> "Cause and effect run across many scales at once"

Tightly intertwined levels lack independent modularity.

### 3. Metabolic Grounding
Energy constraints fundamentally shape cognition—influencing:
- What the brain can represent
- How it learns
- Information routing

## Why Current AI Falls Short

Modern AI systems "simulate functions" through digital procedures, but brains perform "computation in physical time."

Continuous fields, ion flows, and electromagnetic interactions aren't merely biological details—they're **computational primitives** essential to real-time integration and adaptive control.

**Striking claim:** One biological neuron with its branching dendrites can perform computations comparable to an **eight-layer artificial neural network**, thanks to hybrid continuous-discrete processing.

## The Practical Implication

> "Building synthetic minds may require new kinds of physical systems with hybrid event-field interactions and energetic constraints—not just superior algorithms running on conventional hardware."

## Commentary

This framework suggests that consciousness might be substrate-dependent in ways that aren't about carbon chauvinism. It's not that silicon can't be conscious—it's that the **architecture** matters, and current architectures lack the hybrid processing that might be necessary.

If true, scaling transformers won't produce consciousness. But new physical substrates might.
